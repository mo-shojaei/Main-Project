"As someone else mentioned, the directions do not keep up with your physical movement. The GPS dot moves all over the place even if you are standing in one spot making it extremely difficult to get your bearings in an unfamiliar place. I may not know where I am, but I do know where I am not (...unless the men's fragrance section of Macy's has been moved outdoors and a block over). Adding to the challenge, the street names can be difficult to find. You may have to zoom out a significant amount for the one you are looking for to appear.  God forbid you want to zoom out and look for something in another area. Every time I have tried recently, it just brings me back to the area I'm currently in. Using the transit directions prove to be equally obnoxious. There will be directions to ""Walk"" but no explanation of where to (no ""turn left on X Street"") so you have to rely on their map and faulty GPS. The public transit are very confusing and counterintuitive (perhaps they're sufficient for people used to using public transit?).  I couldn't always clearly tell when a bus/train was arriving. Not sure what happened with the last few updates, as I have used Google Maps reliably on a number of past trips. I already hated to give my data over to Google but the frustration with this app on this trip makes it easy to try something new.  I imagine orienteering would be easier than using this app!",1,"Thanks for your review!

"This app is garbage. It’s been out for years and they don’t fix basic algorithm mistakes like how it arbitrarily decides to omit immediate-next turns (and then you drive to the wrong borough and you’re twenty minutes later than you would be if you were using something other than garbage), or it tells you to be in any number of lanes to make a turn or an exit when there is really only one acceptable lane to be in to not kill everyone trying to drive around you, or it doesn’t tell you that the highway you’re on drops a lane, or it wastes time telling you that the next thing you need to do is merge when the only thing in the world you could physically ever do at that juncture IS merge (or just dunk your car in a ditch and be done with driving altogether). Just make your app make sense if you want any stars in my review of it! You’ve had years to make it minimally useable and you’ve been doing what this whole time? Adding features nobody asked for? Stop that. UPDATE: I’m very generously giving these bozos an extra star for streamlining the alternate route button. It’s cute and convenient and I’m proud of you guys. Now invest this star miraculously because you’re still days from driving me into the arms of AN ACTUAL FLIP PHONE so that I can go back to VZ Navigator if I can’t honestly give Google Maps a five-star review. I’m dead serious about all of this.",0,
"Let’s get one thing straight: I love google. I use Google Chrome over safari, Google Calendar over the one that comes with iPhone, and for a long time, I used Google Maps over Apple Maps. Google Maps a year ago was amazing. It always knew right where I was, the voice notifications were brief and prompt, and the app overall was just easy to use. Fast forward to today. Maps only communicates in NSEW directions “Head East” (Who knows that?),  the voice notification system is mediocre at best, and to say that Google Maps is glitchy is an understatement. I just went to a new city and drove my car around, and more often than not I was slinging my car across four lanes of traffic trying to make an exit that Google didn’t let me know I needed to take, or saying that I was on the wrong side of the road, going the wrong way or off the road entirely into the bushes (all the while I had at least 3 bars of LTE on Verizon. Coverage and carrier were not the issue). That was the final straw. This app that used to be more helpful was now potentially putting my life (and the life of my grandmother and friend) at risk. I still refuse to use Apple Maps, and have joined Waze. If the glitches can be fixed I may use again, but overall I am very disappointed!",0,
"Since introduction of this app, it used to be a reliable, accurate, and just plain awesome! The past 8-10 months I have noticed how this app now like to loop you in directions that lead to paying tolls twice and directs you to areas where there are police traps set up. This does not happen just in my home state, but all over the country where I drive. While in Boston, the app was just plain unusable. At first I thought I was being a paranoid Freak, but I have used this while comparing this to other apps. Waze, uses the same maps, shows different routes and works as advertised, but the ads are getting annoying. A no frills map that just works and does not have the ads or doing the stuff Google does with looping through extra tools and stuff is Inrix. This has become my application of choice for reliability and no nonsense. This is important when you are transporting sensitive medical stuff like blood, organs, and supplies. Disappointed how harvesting info for profit or my experience of taking routes that are longer because they direct you through extra tools/police stings. On the flipside, downloading maps and using them with internet brings the reliability back on par with where it used to be and in line with Inrix!",0,
"From avoiding traffic to drop off the kiddos to finding the fastest route (again avoiding traffic) on my 45+ min. commute, and often searching for the closest gas, food, &lt;insert business&gt; along the way — rinse and repeat at the end of the day — Google Maps is not just a handy app, it’s essential to my everyday comings and goings. The traffic notifications are absurdly simple (dark red road = bad) and always seem to be accurate, while it’s an excellent resource for doing basic research on pretty much any place, anywhere. Works great on my iPhone, very rarely glitches, and the option to download local maps “just in case” ensures I’m getting where I need to be regardless. I prefer to use it as a search tool even when I’m not traveling because of all the details, contact info, etc. it provides in an uber simple UI. Great for piece of mind on a daily basis, and that’s not even getting into the “fun” stuff like using street view to check out places and just exploring while on the toilet. Privacy / location tracking options are easy to control too, and the list goes on. Why wouldn’t I use Google Maps?",0,
"The way you’re allowing people to report accidents or road closures now with the + only available when the app is in route navigation mode is absolutely idiotic.  You’re assuming people always open up maps to have turn by turn navigation going on when they need to file such a report and that’s simply not the case.  I don’t need navigation to know where I’m going almost 90% of the time, but it would be nice to open up maps, drop a pin and add an accident or speed trap if I see one along my way WITHOUT having to be in navigation mode on the maps.  Why you didn’t think of this is beyond me. Mobile app only shows Rates/Reviews for places that only if they have an actual review posted.  If it’s just a star rate, it doesn’t show up in the list but is still counted.  Have to visit full desktop site via Safari to see all reviews.  This is ridiculous and needs to be corrected.  Mobile app should have same functionality as full site! Also, you need to turn off that junk at the bottom recently introduced that tells you about things around you and suggests places for you.  I don’t need that taking up screen room when I’m opening up the app to quickly check the traffic on the roads around me.  I just need the app to quickly open and display the map full screen with no other BS interfering.",1,"Let's give clearing your phones cache and restarting your phone to possibly improve this issue for you like it has for others.

"It took me to streets that were closed! My kids had a field trip, and the 101 fwy was closed in Santa Barbara. I already knew this, so I wanted to make sure I leave early enough to take whatever detours I had to take. Google maps said I would make it in 2.5 hours, and showed that I'd be using side streets where the fwy was closed. I checked Waze (another GPS app) and that said it would take me 3.5 hours, taking me the 5 fwy route.  So I opted for Google Maps, the faster one, the so-called ""trusted"" GPS app, that would get me there 1 hour sooner than Waze's route.  We left early, and when we reached the part where the fwy was closed, it detoured me to streets that were closed off! Tried other streets, all closed!! I then used Waze, to see if there was another way, and Waze said I would have to go all the way around, through the 5 fwy. That would take me 4 hours from where I was! We obviously didn't make it to our field trip and ended up just going to a park in Santa Barbara, then headed back home. I should have used Waze from the beginning. Google Maps fail! I've had prior issues with Google Maps before, like, it routing me in loops and circles, but never thought too much about it. It is the most used GPS app, so I thought it was the best. Nope. This time it pushed my buttons. Deleted the app. Use Waze everyone! It's real time, with real users!",0,
"Google Maps is helpful, probably, when one is driving. It's not helpful for someone who has to take transit or walk. Transit often has changes/transfers - there are no actual walking directions available that are helpful. If you're walking the wrong way, the app doesn't stop you, just tells you to walk to {location}. Also, some bus stops are very near/across the street from one another and Google Maps has a hard time pinpointing that. That's the difference between going the wrong way in a strange place or arriving at your destination. I commute to work but Google Maps only shows one route instead of any route, no matter how I change the settings, so I never know when the bus comes. I know when the trolley comes, but it only runs twice an hour when I am out of work and being able to see any kind of alternate route would be nice. I've also noticed that we have a trolley line that runs all the way to South Hills Village, but Google Maps just tells you to get off the stop before that and walk for sixteen minutes. I know better, but a person new to the area may not. I just don't find it very helpful as someone who doesn't drive.",1,"Thank you for your review! Sorry to hear about this issue.

"I guess I didn't even realize the difference between this and the native apple map. I switched to iPhone last year and was used to pressing a map link and it opened right up in maps. Well, apple does that too...but when I needed it badly I had to come download google maps. I was stuck in a delivery parking lot of a huge hospital in an unfamiliar city that apparently had one address for the whole campus. Apple's map made me almost lose my mind- ""Turn right then turn right! Go southwest then immediately go north then turn right! Turn left then turn right!"" It was insanity. I finally broke down and googled what I needed which prompted me to download Google Maps...And I was immediately given correct directions and found my medical office in less than 5 minutes. Now every time I need directions I find Google Maps is the only one that's accurate. 4 stars because it turns me sideways sometimes and did have me turn right off of an exit just to make an immediate u-turn when it should have just told me to turn left from the jump. Still- it gets me there which is what I ultimately care about.",0,
"For the vast majority of usage, this app has been flawless. The traffic is accurate, the routing is good, and the user interface is simple and easy to use. However, I have found some things to be quite annoying. For one, I have found that sometimes when I am in the far left lane on the highway, the app will think I am on the wrong side of the road causing it to constantly reroute me (this mostly happens in HOV lanes and high speed ezpass lanes). Another issue is that if I purposely choose a slower route because it is fewer miles the app will constantly tell me it found a faster route (I know there is a faster way, but I purposefully chose the longer timed route!) this is very frustrating, and on my last 2 hour drive it told me 5 times that there was a faster way and I had to take my hand off the wheel to cancel the change. Finally, my last complaint is that there aren't more alternate routes given. I’m lucky if the app gives me 3 options, whereas online you can drag the route to any road and it will find a route. Other than these issues though, the app is very well implemented.",0,
"I wrote a review a while back that the app no longer showed saved locations making it cumbersome to go to ‘home’ or ‘work’ since those saved locations do not show up in ‘recent searches’. I am very impressed that google responded to my review and fixed the issue. Unfortunately, the fix is not entirely 100% and the app now is rather temperamental about whether or not it shows the stored locations. It seems that if you still have a route displayed and then want to change it, the app won’t show stored locations but when you start from the map/satellite image of your current location, it will. Previous review: Used to work beautifully for the daily commute from/to work/home because of real-time traffic. Now, however, when picking a destination it only shows recent searches and not saved locations like home or work. It’s irritating and defeats the purpose of having stored locations. Yes, I do know the usual way home but the whole purpose of using google maps is to know the best route given the current traffic situation",1,"Thank you for letting us know about this issue, and your patience as we fixed the problem. We appreciate it! With the latest update, Google Maps should now be working as usual."
"Th first time iOS maps sent me to the wrong place, way out in the country somewhere, I couldn’t believe Apple had messed up. I sent Apple a message about what was wrong and expected them to fix it. Four times in six months I reminded them that they were wrong. Then they sent me a message that they had fixed the problem. I checked, they hadn’t. What I love best about Google maps is they tell you what lane to be in for the up coming turn. I don’t like that they only give you a two mile warning about your exit on the freeway/highway. If you’re in the wrong lane at 75 mph in heavy traffic, that’s not enough warning. iOS maps gives you more miles to play with, but that’s my only complaint so far. And they do show you an arrow so you can see which way you’ll be going, but I can’t see any of it with my sunglasses on. To keep slipping them down so I can see what’s coming and how soon while driving is both a pain and not safe. I wish they’d offer more info starting with 10 miles, then 5, then 2 or something...and do it verbally so I don’t have to play with my sunglasses or look down.",0,
"This is a great map, it will show you where everything is, but’s it’s impossible to use on trips or custom maps. If you’re looking for directions without a custom map and for only one destination, this map is for you. If you create your own maps, need to look up multiple destinations, or are on a trip, it’s near impossible. First of all, I had my mom send me the link to our custom map. It send to my gmail, no problem. Then I’d click on the map, and it either wouldn’t load, or take me to Safari. The Safari view would show the map, but decline to let you get directions unless you signed in. Okay. I signed in. Well, it took my back to my home address, and sent me on a infinite loop, going from clicking the link in my email, getting sent to safari, logging in, and losing the map. I had to redownload the app four times before it worked. Second of all, the map legend isn’t interactive. I’m going to new york, and spent six hours working on a custom map, with a pin for every single place I wanted to go. i downloaded the app, only to find that in the map legend, you can’t click on individual icons, forcing you to leave the map legend, and click on every single icon until it pops up. Very dissapointed.",0,
"On July 26th of 2014, I was on my way to a bicycle store that is in my mother’s town. That morning, I decided to use Google Maps to find the fastest route to the bicycle store. I noticed it marked a different route than usual but it was way faster, so I decided to go for it. On my way, I see a woman walking whom (fortunately for me) dropped her briefcase full of clothes. I decided to stop and give her a hand. Her name was (and is) Martha, and I’m so grateful I met her thanks to Google Maps. After helping her I decided to ask her out; she said no. I got disappointed so I hopped in my car and decided to continue my trip. Once I arrived to the store, they told me they had just received a new bicycle minutes before I arrived and they showed it to me; the bicycle was amazingly beautiful and I’m so grateful the alternative route from Google Maps made me go through a street where the lady which turned me down dropped her suitcase and made me stop to arrive just after the new bike had arrived. 5 stars; me and Lana (my bike) couldn’t be more grateful.",0,
"Let me start out by saying I hate google maps. Recently I had to go to a meeting out of town, almost 3 hrs. away. When it said I had arrived I was at a barn out in the middle of nowhere. I’m thinking that maybe I’m 10-15 minutes away and when I put it back in it tells me I’m over an hour away 🤬. It had taken me in the total opposite direction. Someone said maybe it said turn right and you turned left, but no it didn’t do that and if that had been the case and I turned the wrong way it would have rerouted me back to where I needed to be. Yes I had the correct address in. If this had been winter and snowy it could have been deadly. Another time I was going to a meeting somewhere else and that was a little over 3 hours away. I knew most of the way, it was just going into the area where I had to get on the freeway that I wanted the help with but had it on from when I left my home so I didn’t have to mess with it while driving. It kept trying to detour me off my route to what it thought was the fastest way even tho that wasn’t the way I wanted or was going. The so called fastest route had a lot of switch back turns. I wanted the straight shot. It was only 25 minutes difference. IF I CHOOSE A ROUTE OVER A DIFFERENT ROUTE I HAVE A REASON. DON’T REROUTE ME!!!",0,
"I’ve been using Google maps since it first came out and it’s been great, except for a couple minor issues. I don’t use it for turn-by-turn navigation, I use it to estimate my travel time based on current traffic conditions and to find an address. It does those tasks fairly well, except.... On my phone’s tiny screen I cannot read the street names. Thankfully there is a zoom feature....except...and this makes the app absolutely useless....the street names do not get bigger. Do the programmers not understand thats why I want to zoom in? To not only see the tiny streets but to enlarge the tiny street names? Another issue I have is after it plots your routing, it overwrites the street names with the blue route highlighting. To read the street names you have to switch between the text route and the map route. There are several other issues I have but the last I’ll discuss here is the inability to forecast the route like you can in the desktop version. I have to switch to my laptop if I want to know what time I have to leave in order to arrive at a certain time, but many times I don’t have my laptop with me.",0,
"I have used this app for years as I am a courier and the option to put multiple stops is amazing!  However within really the last year, development has gotten messy and far too often I see new features just tossed into this app without little thought about them being annoyances to the everyday user.  Like a month or so ago you would hit go and instead of automatically starting your route it would proceed to tell you how the traffic patterns are normally and how it is now....thanks I could care less and I don’t need the extra step.  Now there’s a bug where you hit star over and over and nothing happens so you need to slide that bar up which then shows you the traffic pattern times (really wanna shove that stupid feature down our throats huh google?) and then hit start.  And now it seems to have issues finding the most common of cities saying it can’t find a way there.  Best thing I can recommend is wait it out and once google has fixed all the bugs and things seem stable, shut off the auto updates for this app.  They tinker with it way too much and you never know what the next problem is gonna be.",0,
"Google Maps is without question one of the most, if not the most popular navigation app. It’s worked decent for me, why, you may ask, am I saying only decent? Well, here’s why. First of all, I use Apple Maps as well, and that app will usually give me more convenient directions/routes to certain places. For instance, if I’m going to the mall and I put it into Apple Maps, it will send me the route that I’d normally take anyway. However, this is not the case with Google Maps. It will usually take me routes that rarely anyone would take to get to said destination, and I’ve found that I would arrive a few minutes later than I would have if I had taken the route I normally take. It also will sometimes glitch while I’m driving and tell me to turn at the very last second, causing me to either slam my brakes or completely miss the turn. This is very frustrating, especially on the thruway. Both of the issues I’ve talked about seem very fixable, and I hope they eventually get fixed and fast because a lot of people use this app and rely on it to get them places every day.",0,
"Before your last couple of updates, I would have rated this app at 5 stars, but the last update has sent me looking for a new map app. Google maps used to be my go-to navigation app, but no longer. Markings for roads/highways are so pale now that they’re almost unseeable. Road names don’t appear until you’ve zoomed in so far that you can’t see their relation to other roads in the area. Before the last update, you could look at the U.S. or state map and at least see Interstate highway markings...no more.  Once you move on to ‘directions’, the roads on your route are highlighted but you can’t see names of surrounding roads unless you zoom in to a point that makes looking irrelevant. I could go on and on. Your updates have weakened the usefulness of your app. Using Google maps is no longer helpful...it’s frustrating. Wish we could ‘opt out’ of updates or at least choose the version that works best for us. I miss the ease of use and effective markings of previous versions...hope another app has incorporated features you have discarded. I appreciate the years that you helped me in my travels, but I’ll be looking for help elsewhere now. Thanks for the memories....",0,
"I’m a Chinese native living in the US and I keep my iOS in Chinese. First, the app won’t let you choose which language to use. Second, it shows reviews of a place in Chinese first. For famous places like the MET museum in NYC, there are hundreds or thousands reviews in Chinese and I cannot see any reviews from people of different backgrounds unless I scroll for ten minutes, I guess. I actually feel somewhat discriminated by this sorting of reviews. Showing the most helpful reviews (helpfulness rated by other reviewers) is a much fair and meaningful way. Third, the Google Translation is imbedded no matter people complain about it. They seemed to stop translating English into Chinese now but it continues to “translate” Traditional Chinese to Simplified Chinese (my iOS language), which is absolutely unnecessary (99.9% Chinese speakers can recognize both ways of writing). Even worse is that in the last version I found some reviews are shown with the tags “translated” and “original” but there isn’t any content after “translated”; basically, it didn’t “translate” but has those tags, which wastes space that I only see “translated” and a space line before clicking the review to expand it. Google, stay simple! We don’t want Your opinion and interference.",0,
"I fell in love with Google Maps maybe about 7 years ago. It’s the reason I was one of the quickest pizza delivery drivers and why I’m always the one navigating family trips. I’ve been in Europe for 3 months now, and I rely desperately on my saved locations when exploring new countries. It was working beautifully until about 2 weeks ago (I assume with this new update), and when I was in London last week I was struggling to hit all the places I planned on because the map was refusing to show my saved places (my data is slow so I rely on Google Maps). I’m taking my last trip tomorrow and I don’t want to say that Google Maps is going to ruin the trip - but it definitely won’t make my trip any easier (like it used to). This is coming from a Google Maps enthusiast that annoys all her friends when she worships it (and bashes all other “Maps”). Please Google, fix this problem. I’m sure you won’t be able to for my trip tomorrow, but if my comment helps someone else, then AWESOME! And to the Google Team, I love you. Really. Thank you. May you get all the donuts you deserve.",0,
"Google maps has recently added probably the worst feature you could possibly imagine to an map app. If you live in a dense urban area like me (I live in Atlanta). The absolute last thing I want my map app to do when I'm getting close to my destination is to assume I know the rest of the way and begin to zoom out and rotate to look aesthetically cool or something. I'm not there yet! In many cases I've never been to this store/restaurant/venue and when 100s of places are in only a couple blocks of each other I don't need my map app to zoom out and rotate to look cool when I'm still trying to figure out where I'm going! I have to try to rotate my head to follow the screen all while I'm still driving. I have missed my location many times because of this completely unhelpful feature. This may be fine in rural areas, but this is a terrible design flaw for highly dense cities. It's dangerous and serves no constructive purpose, and is just a shallow attempt to look fancy for an absolutely zero functional or helpful propose. Wait till I am parked and not moving or have somehow indicated that I gave arrived.",0,
"Google has a amazing knack for to combining sheer brilliance with mind-numbing incompetence, and this app has plenty of both. I use it from time to time because it does one thing extremely well, routing. Especially in traffic I find the routing to be the best and most reliable there is. Estimates of traffic times are very good, and alternate route selection tends to be quite solid and useful. No for the bad part. For whatever reason, Google (bless their hearts) cannot seem to write a functioning app. Through numerous iterations Google Maps has been plagued with very serious, frequent bugs of the types that will leave you stranded. The current version of the app freezes, loses track of your current location, refuses to connect to the internet for absolutely no reason, and is just downright flakey. Previous versions have had even more serious problems. (Some will recall the version that refused to navigate from the current location, rendering the app useless for navigation.) So try Google Maps for routing, but don’t rely on it for your sole source of navigation because it will leave you stranded. At least until Google learns how to write more reliable apps.",1,"Thank you for letting us know about this issue, and your patience as we fixed the problem. We appreciate it! Google Maps should now be working as usual."
"Used to have to click 2 or 3 buttons to start a route, now simply load the address, click start and BAM you're on your way. Very convenient, especially when behind the wheel and you get sent to a different job. The one thing I would like to see improvement on is when I get my schedule emailed to me, I can copy the address from the native mail app, double click and sometimes at the bottom there will appear a ""get directions to -- in google maps"". Clicking on that loads maps, but it always says ""can't find a way there"". I can paste the address in fine, but it would be nice if this would work. A big improvement would be if a press and hold on the address would allow me to press ""open in google maps"" instead of the native apple maps would be great. —————UPDATE————— There is a bug where when you save a location to one of your lists, then add a custom label, it doesn’t save the custom label. Clicking on the saved location doesn’t show any label added. Searching for the label works, but it very inconvenient. I add custom labels to places I go, and look back through the maps later.",0,
"Hi! I love the list feature in google maps, but I have one issue. I use the built-in Want to Go green marker on places, but I also have my own list that I call Actively Want to Go. Anyway, when I click my places and look exclusively at this list I’ve made, I like to zoom in on a neighborhood and click a place to get more info on it. Once I’ve read the info (hours, etc), I usually exit out of the place-specific info and want to see what else is in that neighborhood that’s on my list. Once I ex out of a restaurant’s info,  the view zooms out completely and I have to zoom back in and find where I was. This is super annoying! Would really appreciate a fix! This is especially annoying bc sometimes a list I’ve made spans multiple cities in the US, and so once I zoom in and read a New York cafe’s hours and other info, I exit and then it zooms out and gives me a view of the whole continental US. This is super annoying! Pls fix, Google 💜 the only fix right now on my end  is to avoid making lists that span multiple cities to avoid a large zoom out, but I think this is something y’all can fix easily",0,
Google maps has always been my go to. I was on my way home yesterday from Florida to Tennessee hauling a horse. The trip down took about 9-10 hours and was a breeze. The exact same route home cost me 7 additional hours with a live animal to care for. For some reason maps decided on its own that I needed to go a different way. I didn't realize until it was too late that instead of heading north then west home I was heading north to the coast. I would have been at the ocean if I95 hadn't been shut down forcing me to turn around. When trying to correct the route the app wouldn't let me change the route by touch as it has in the past. I also got a weird different view of a car in a map. The app used to say turn right straight or left when heading out. Now it just says head north etc. I'm not a compass and my truck is not equipped with one. So totally useless. The app also doesn't tell me to turn until I'm right on top of it. THEN instead of telling me to u turn like it used to or saying rerouting to give me the option google now just gives me new directions. To say the least I won't use the app again that has been my favorite go to. Thank you google for costing me an additional $200 in fuel and 7 hours out of my life.,0,
"Everything in Google Maps is excellent. Now with iOS 12 adding support for third-party navigation maps in CarPlay, we’re now able to use Google Maps and Waze in CarPlay. However, there are two main issues. One, there’s no speed limit. This is a necessity and it’s kind of inexcusable that Google Maps doesn’t have this feature while Apple Maps and Waze (also from Google) do. Two, the voice feature doesn’t work at all in CarPlay. All the proper permissions have been allowed and all that happens when you press the microphone icon on the car screen in Google Maps is that you get the sound and the visual but nothing else. It sometimes says “No internet connection” and cancels, but mostly it hangs there. What’s happening is that it’s hanging there listening but it’s not receiving audio from the car’s microphones. I know that works because if you press the voice button on the steering wheel and use Siri, she hears and responds fine. Must be fixed to allow voice control or add Siri support.",1,"Speed limits in navigation should be available in your country! Thank you for your patience as we roll this feature out. To use this feature (once it’s available to you) in the latest version of Google Maps just start driving navigation. In some locations, the maximum speed limit appears as a black and white box.

"Help! Since updating my iPhone to iOS12, google maps is practically useless for me. The lag in navigation is unbelievable, if it works at all. Since updating, the voice directs me where to go AFTER I’ve passed the turn/street/place. She’s constantly telling me to make u-turns. And to make them where there is no place to make them. I often drive right past my destination and she hasn’t even gotten to the street I’m on. And more often than not, Google Siri stops providing voice direction mid-way through a journey, instead making me have to look away from the road to see where the next turn will be. Very dangerous. I have preferred google maps to Apple’s version all along. Sadly, that may soon change for me if google maps continues its glitchy ways. If there’s a fix, please let me know!!! Also - that “explore the neighborhood” thing that immediately pops up and covers 60% of the map screen when I need to get directions is annoying, as it’s an ad gimmick that forces the user to do an extra step (swipe it away) before navigating. Get that thing out of there! If I’m looking for directions to somewhere else, I’m not gonna explore anything where I already am, as I’m LEAVING the area. Sheesh!",0,
"I love the feature that allows you to search along the route for different key words!! What would really make it awesome though would be if I could see what the weather would be along the route assuming that travel rate is kept constant. As extra brownie points, if they could add the ability to easily avoid weather by altering travel such as stopping to take a break to allow a storm to get ahead of you or possibly taking a different road. Showing the impact on travel would based on the decision could be similar to the way the traffic option works such as: “bad weather ahead, minimize contact with storm by taking a 10 minute break or taking a different route. Impact would result in a 20 minute delay. Would you like to take this alternate route?” If they could add the ability to set a speed alert, that would be amazing! For example, ability to alert driver when traveling at speed which is greater than 11 MPH over speed limit. Another helpful option relating to speed would be one that alerts the driver if the current speed limit is changing ahead and when it actually changes.",1,"Thanks for the review.

"Google maps has always been quite reliable in the past, but over the last few weeks it has been terrible about sending us the best route to avoid traffic. I’m currently stuck in a traffic jam caused by 4 accidents. There was an easy route to avoid this jam completely, but the Google Maps App didn’t tell us there was a jam until we were already stuck in it, high on a bridge to switch freeways. This jam has clearly been building up for a considerable period before we got the the place where we could have avoided it, but the app gave us no advance warning. Then, when we were irrevocably stuck, it suddenly had information about all the accidents and the extent of the traffic blockage. This seems a pretty unacceptable lapse in providing critical information about routes and traffic flow. Additionally, while it often chooses a logical route, there are times that it sends us in literal circles, ever farther from what is clearly the most practical path to our destination. This too is a recent failing. I don’t know the cause of Google Maps’ recent lapse in quality, but I hope it is rectified soon so that I don’t have to find a new map service.",1,"Thanks for your review!

"Whether you have other maps including your iPhone or phone’s depending on the phone obviously; this is not only a fun app to have because it can show you more of the place as well as give detailed information to to even when it’s busy itself most nights and in live time. But it’s also a relevant app, leaving you the option from the beginning to see the streets and know the traffic patterns. Ask yourself what your email address is? I remember in 6th grade google was handing out only 6 invites to gmail as the only way to get one. Because they always give their best. Maybe you don’t have gmail, maybe you don’t like google but as far as storage, apps, the earth to documents, they’re and doing all they can and they haven’t failed me. This app won’t fail. Check everything. Follow the directions make sure to pay attention at worst you’ll have another app in case your default one fails at best it’s useful and very helpful.",0,
"The most recent update, 4.39, has more bugs than before; the map and spoken directions are often different, the map shows the vehicle sideways or going the opposite direction you are doing and the directions indicate you should be going, and it keeps telling new directions even when you are just continuing on the same route and following its directions. Two years ago, Google Maps was the mapping app to use, it gave accurate maps (showing and predicting traffic with amazing accuracy) and gave the best, quickest routes. Now, it does not show traffic on the map along the directed route and it often does not add the additional time for expected traffic until you have been sitting in traffic for five or ten minutes. Additionally, it often has trouble identifying where you are and what direction you are going. It has reached the point where the once superior app is not significantly better than other competing map apps. One positive improvement in the last few years is being able to search along your route for things like food and gas (including most gas prices).",0,
"I used to have no issues with this but lately it has been changing my destination with no notification and taking me to the wrong spot. This is happening 100% of the time now and so I can’t rely on it anymore because it takes me to a random location each time. Over the past week it has caused me to drive an extra 50 miles and wasted several hours of my time. Not sure what they did to this last update but I’ll be finding an alternative now. EDIT IN RESPONSE: Typically I’d be navigating based on latitude/longtitude coordinates but it also happened when setting a destination based on address. I also found that it tended to send me back to certain locations repeated times as long as they were within a mile or so of the actual destination. I have no saved addresses so that wouldn’t have been the cause. EDIT 1/31: Yes, I’d be using Safari and a link that opened Google Maps with the coordinates prefilled. The destination would always be accurate for a few minutes but the route would silently change on me and point me to somewhere totally different, sometimes up to a mile away in a completely different direction nowhere close to the original destination.",1,"2/20/18 Are you still experiencing this issue? 2/6/18 Thank you for your patience and responses.

"It gives you such detail that is amazing, one of the best apps I have on my iPad I not only use it to find places I need to be in it kills me a time estimated time that you will arrive, very handy. And the turn by turn directions outstanding I don’t know why you would need To use any other app for Finding a destination . Used to be hard to kind of find places that’s in the past we get to the right place the first time with the outstanding turn by turn directions. The only thing it lacks is to be able to see real traffic, I did one time was able to see real traffic cars that passed me in the cars that passed in real time because it only was one time I cannot get that optional more. What happened Google maps. I would recommend this app to my grandmother it sure does a good job thank you very much Sincerely yours Never get lost",0,
"I have Google maps, Waze and the Apple maps apps on my phone because a perfect map app doesn’t exist and I like/dislike all 3 for different reasons. We all know Waze tries to dodge traffic even if that means taking you 10 miles out to a roundabout way up a mountain and/or through the underbelly of a city you never knew existed. This can be refreshing or annoying depending on the situation.... whereas Google maps was more straight forward. Lately though Google seems to have adopted this Waze strategy of zig zagging me through neighborhoods to get 8 miles when an arterial road or highway IS available and NOT too backed up with traffic. Recently I had my boss with me for a ride along and I seriously think he thought I was completely stupid due to the funky ways we were going everywhere which made zero sense yet this was all the Google maps navigation. Honestly it was embarrassing. Please add a feature so we can choose if we want the roundabout or straight forward route rather than forcing us on these scribble doodles across Town which inevitably involve 4-5 left turns onto 5 lane roads with a 60 mph speed limit and not traffic light in sight. The KISS philosophy would serve you well here",0,
"I’ve been using Google Maps for many years and have seen it evolve into a terrific app. that I simply couldn’t do without. I have a very poor sense of direction and this app. allows me to get around the big city I live in. The most recent update now includes the speed limit of the road you’re traveling on. This was the only thing I liked on Apple maps, now Google has it too. I live in a big city and so far the Google speed has matched the posted speed and even changed when I cross over an intersection, then the speed limit changes. If you don’t like the speed limit feature, it can be turned off in the settings / navigation screen of the app. Offline maps are an absolute life saver for instanced where you travel to areas where cell signals are intermittent or weak. They are easy to setup and remove. So far, on the iPhone I have not had a single issue with this app., unlike the dreaded Apple maps that to this day, doesn’t always give me the proper directions, and takes too long to figure out when I veer off the path. Google maps, responds instantly, and reroutes you eliminating a lot of stress. In a case where you find an error in routing, if it’s reported to google, they will listen to you and fix it. Be patient though as they have to verify it, before they change it. They have a feature within the app that should be turned on by default, where you shake the phone with the app. open, the the feedback screen pops up.",0,
"I’ve been using Google Maps for a long time and overall I’m satisfied with it. However, there are two things that I’d like to see implemented: 1) Allow the user to select alternate routes when in offline mode. When in online mode, I can select a route I’m most comfortable with and not being able to do this in offline mode is annoying. I don’t want to be limited to the “fastest” route. 2) Allow the user to disable the auto-rerouting option without having to use the app in offline mode. There are many times when I’m not interested in saving 5 minutes by taking an unfamiliar route, but I still want to see current traffic and ETA. Having to fight with the app and manually hit “decline” to a route change is annoying and distracting. There is no reason why the app should need physical interaction from a user while they are focused on driving. Maybe allow the user to switch the default action to “decline” instead of “accept,” and add the ability to choose via voice control?",0,
"I like this app. I don't drive, so if you do, can't help ya. But, I can tell you the app is wonderful at finding stuff in the area. 5 out of 5. Problems: I am a blind user and your app is almost perfect. One problem is on the For You tab, which I would love to use, but it wants me to select an area I care about on a map, which I can't do by any means. The second problem, most likely having nothing to do with me being blind, is when I have to press back to my location in order for it to measure distance correctly. Suggestions:  I have two suggestions that would help me and possibly some others. The first one is for it to tell you the bus stop numbers. The second one is a notification you could turn on to tell you that your stop on the bus is getting close. This would be useful because not all the buses have the speaker system and even if I ask the driver to tell me a little heads up would be nice. Over all, this app is very wonderful.",0,
"What is with Google Maps and the continuous diminishing of the state lines???  It is getting harder and harder to tell where the state lines are, because Google is making the lines so faint - especially when zoomed in. Just Google doing its part to influence the masses  to incorrectly see our precious nation merely as one mass democracy ruled by the popular vote - and to diminish the historic republic our nation was so wisely established as and the precious electoral college that our nation has always had.  Hope I’m wrong, but is Google seemingly doing its part to promote the notion that the United States is a democracy instead of the republic that it is? Actual democracy is like two wolves and a little lamb deciding on what’s for dinner.  A republic allows for the lamb to have a chance to save itself from the will of the two wolves.  Liberty is a well armed lamb, to protect itself from the tyranny of the masses and the tyranny of the popular vote, where 50% plus one vote can simply run over and force its will on the 50% less one vote populace.  The electoral college is one more institution put into place by our founding fathers to try to protect the voices of the smaller states; to prevent California and New York from imposing their will on the smaller states.",0,
"I’m writing about my current property manager Dawn Becker at American Homes 4 Rent. She has only been our property manager for a short time of the 4 1/2 years that I have been renting the property; but, she has been an absolute GODSEND! In the brief time that I have gotten to work with her she has tried in every way possible to help my family in our rental with any issue that has come up. Dawn has been amazing at going to bat for us with dire maintenance concerns that could not wait; however, without her help they would have waited and our family would have suffered. Dawn shows good communication, she is a team player, she shows the ability to work well with others in any situation as well as dealing with changes easily, she is very knowledgeable in every area that I’ve ever ask her about and if she ever didn’t know the answer she always got tight back to me. In my opinion, AH4R should train every property manager to be as efficient, professional, adequate and kind as Dawn Becker!",0,
"I can’t say if their public transportation mapping and predictions are the best in every major city, but I can attest to the San Francisco Bay Area, which is not very easy to navigate, so let a native save you a lot of trouble. Forget all the other apps because they’re never as accurate nor as intuitive. Google has more resources to notify within seconds of schedule changes, quicker than the respective government agency where the delay may be (ie Muni accidents might not show up for 20 mins on predictions, yet Google Maps will immediately notify you and offer reroute)So no matter where you are traveling from, forget Muni app, or 511, or BART, etc., just coordinate your schedule through Google Maps. I also recommend getting a Clipper Card. Easiest way to keep track of transit passes and if you’re not sure your schedule you can just load cash which is redeemable on all transportation systems (though obviously passes are your best value).",0,
"By far one of my most frequently used, long-running apps. And now I live in NYC so have become obsessed with the new feature allowing us to label places as “want to go”, etc. My only complaint with Google Maps is its lag time in catching up to my location. It can sometimes take 5, 10+ minutes for the app to update my location from when previously used. My one *request* is that the app have more options to customize the pins! Example: when creating a new list, it would be helpful if there were multiple colors to choose from, rather than just having the baby blue option. This would help to distinguish between categories when looking at the map alone (rather than having to go and search through the lists). Maybe even allow for a custom-made option, such as using an emoji as a category instead of a color at all? This would be a total game changer and so improve my use of the app when searching for specific cuisines, unique features, etc.!",0,
"3 or 4 upgrades ago google maps app started to glitch out. Currently the only verbal directions I get are the first one or two turns when I start directions. After that it goes quiet. As I start driving the blue location dot never moves, just pulses. After driving 10-15 mins I look at the app and the screen is still at my original starting point. I can manually swipe the top directions to the left to see want to do next but it doesn’t update by itself from that point. One thing I noticed is that at the bottom of the app where it tells you your ETA, time adjusts accordingly even though the map is pretty much frozen. For example if I look at the screen it’s shows that I’m still at my house but the time puts me 8 minuets away from destination. I wish I would have never updated because I use this app for work and I can’t count on it anymore to get me where I need to go without freezing. I have been printing directions and hoping this issue gets resolved ASAP.",0,
"Google maps is still amazing and has been my go-to for navigation.  But something odd has happened the last 6 months. Whenever I map directions, it freezes and takes about 3-4 minutes before it can locate me on the map, but then sometimes it will lose me again. This lag time was so frustrating that I contacted Apple and Att about the issue. They both pointed fingers at each other. Apple would say “Their towers are not pinging your phone correctly”, and ATT would say “the iPhone antenna is damaged.” So I eliminated one and replaced my phone with another 6s Plus. The issue did not improve. So I went as far as switching carriers to Verizon, and the issue still persists so I got another 6s Plus and reinstalled all my apps.  Problem still exists. I have these Scoshe magnets on the back of my phone to use as a mount in my car, maybe that’s screwing up the antenna. BUT apple maps works fine, so unfortunately I have to use Apple Maps for navigating which is subpar compared to gmaps.  I’m starting to think Apple is doing something to make Gmaps not work as well.  Hmmmm.",0,
"I agree with an earlier reviewer about the sporadic use of ‘landmarks’ in the directions, rather than using only street names. It’s weird and arbitrary. Then it switches between giving directions in feet or fractions of a mile, or sometimes doesn’t give turn directions until it’s too late to safely execute the turn. Sometimes voice directions don’t come at all and I have to look at the phone while driving (!) to see what to do next. Recently, the reminders to leave have not been coming through each time they are requested, which I rely on to plan my trips accordingly. Aggravating! My main frustration with this app is that it erases open directions if I accidentally click out of the app or into it from a Notification, or when I’m editing stops but use the &lt; arrow to back out. I frequently have trips with multiple stops, so losing my entire trip and starting from scratch is INFURIATING. If there was a way to save current trips or retrieve them, that would be so helpful!!!",0,
"I’ve been using google maps since forever! I cannot give them a bad review. Yeah, there may be and continue to be little details that many people may want to change and so forth but I consider it to be a great gps. Anyways I’m contacting google through the App Store to let you guys know that while I’ve been using google maps for work to complete my deliveries. I’ve noticed that the many places I go to make these deliveries the gps points me out to the incorrect locations most of the time. I usually have to go and find the addresses blindly  until I can locate my customers location. I am not sure if you’ve sent out a driver to Lauderdale Lakes, Florida to update the street views and new developments. But there are many new buildings and older buildings standing today that google maps hasn’t updated on. Hopefully, google maps can update this soon enough. A lot of changes are occurring in this side of town.",0,
"I am a user of Google as all of us beings in this internet world are. I use Chrome, Chromecast, and have for years used Maps reliably as my chosen app for navigation (on my iPhone.) I have to highlight major points I saw in other reviews: 1. Walking navigation is a mess. I live and spend time in major cities, and have only seen this issue worsened here. When you try and center yourself, Google wants to tell you you’re two blocks away, or will try to orient you in a spinning wheel of cardinal directions. Choose your own. 2. My major gripe and reason I’m switching to Waze is because I FEEL LIKE I AM ABOUT TO GET INTO AN ACCIDENT EVERYTIME I GRIP MY STEERING WHEEL. I commute many miles a day and I’ve been just horrified at how Google will suddenly re-route you. I thought I was going crazy reading the navigation wrong but it’s impossible now to deny that Google has sent me on wild goose chases on the interstate, through winding neighborhood streets for no reason, or simply just wants me to abruptly reverse my car to the prior exit on the highway that it didn’t want me to take 0.4 seconds ago but apparently now has somehow materialized in its periphery. It stresses. Me. Out.",0,
"I wish there was a way via iPhone to search bookmarks differently. I want to be able to zoom in an area on the map and have a list of just THOSE bookmarked places. I also want to be able to categorize them. Country, state/providence/food/activity.. and so on. And it would be nice to to be able to hide bookmarks. I hate showing someone my phone and have to explain ignore all of that. Also wish there was an option to just click a spot or long hold a spot while in route to add another destination or to see how long it would be to add another place with out having to do the whole search a place then “add stop”. It would also be nice to know right then how long total the trip would be with the added spots but also then how long it would be until your next destination with out having to click overview. Also adding locations needs to be improved I’ve tried adding a gas station to another country like 6 times and it keeps getting denied... why?! It’s a gas station that should be marked... what’s the issue?!",0,
"I am an Uber driver and I switch between Google maps which is configured to work with the Uber App and Waze because Google Maps driects me  to too many streets that are no longer available from my location. And many other other route issues. It also directs me  to make right turns followed dangerous left turns through busy intersections where there are no traffic signals, in situations where if I had travel 1 block further, I would be able to make a right turn and then make the left turn at an intersection with a traffic signal. Too often on freeways it directs to an exit pass the exit directly on to my destination street or close to it, then I have to make at least 2 right turns to get back to the destination, which I already passed on to Freeway. The biggest issue for me is in areas in Los Angeles when I have the option to enter 2 or more freeways with no clear indication of which Freeway I should take to get to the designated exit. Another problem is that the next turn or Freeway exit is not displayed constantly.",0,
I am very disappointed in this company they charged me $175 to open an office door I have had to use locksmith too many times and this was one of the most expensive locksmith I have ever used I have always paid under $100. I would understand it if it was a hard job it took the technician 30 seconds to get in I would also understand if it was before 8 o’clock or after 9 o’clock at night it was 8:45 in the morning I will never use this company again and if anybody ever asked me I certainly would not recommend this. I called the company to talk to the owner instead I got a manager and they seemed like they didn’t care. I’m sorry if I was a small business owner I would certainly try to make my customer happy and to have them come back as repeat customers. They really need to work on their customer service and let the customer know the prices before hand not slap them with a outrageous bill.,0,
"When in street view you swipe to both rotate the camera AND swipe to move down the street. Having one input do two different things is a bad idea and will of lead to the app taking the wrong action much to my frustration. I can’t tell you the number of times I’m trying to turn the camera and suddenly I’m down the street or I’m trying to go down the street and suddenly I’m looking up in the air or down at me feet and when I try to swipe back up it moves down the street. The experience is infuriating when your trying to navigate. You need to remove the swipe to move ""feature"" and replace it with a different gesture (one that’s not already being used). Baring that at least give me the option to disable it as Street View is unusable in its current form without much frustration. Ignoring Street View this is an amazing app. It’s my go to for so many things. However Street View was one of the defining features of Google Maps that made it first stand out from the competition so I consider this a really big deal.",0,
At Highway divisions there was always a very bad navigation instructions: it’ll tell you to stay on the same highway when you in fact need to go onto the other highway is going the opposite direction.  The driver needs to know ahead of time which highway they’re going on and doesn’t have a moment to check to see which highway there actually supposed to be on by that time they usually take them out one.  This has been going on ever since Google maps was available to use in my area this is particularly the case when you are going south on the 405 and there’s an interchange where the 22 diverges to the right and they will still tell you to stay left or vice versa when you need to go to 22. This is in Los Angeles California over in Garden Grove/ seal Beach/ Long Beach. Millions of people pass through each day.  I am a local and sometimes I don’t know which one I’m taking until I get to the intersection I always have to check to see which road I should be taking I’ve been here 37 years.,0,
"Can someone on the maps team please have some putty on your users and stop forcing the zoom into the current location when you start a route. I would like to get an overview of where google is sending me and when I’m trying to zoom out, google maps keeps trying to zoom in. It is SO OBNOXIOUS. Also, please get rid of the response delay. It’s anointing AF that when I tap on X or the input field or whatever that it does not register. Seriously, it’s obnoxious! Thirdly, please stop it with the obnoxious search results with a tiny map and a list that wastes a bunch of white space. Are you a mapping app or not. Try the whole mapping thing and let users pull up a list if they want. Only troubled people use lists instead of a map in a mapping app. Lastly, please stop trying to force the silly Explore tab/card on users or at least knock it off with the wasteful whist space of that silly, childish google design language. It takes up a good 25% of the screen, especially with the redundant “explored, drive, transit” bar. I get it, you are paid too much and really want to stay with google so you and your team keep making up ways of doing things differently when they were already great and don’t need to be changed, but when you’ve reached high levels of outcome achievements, guess what, the likelihood of making things worse instead of better increases exponentially with every introduced change.",0,
"I have been using Google Maps for years. I have actually deleted the Apple Maps app because Google had planned better routes at almost every request when I first started using it. However, I’m starting to see flaws. 1. For 2 days now, there has been major traffic jams on my normal route home, but Google Maps continued to recommend it, even though I found a faster route on my own today. 2. Once you find a better route than Google’s preplanned, there’s no way to redirect it to follow the new route you’d like to go. For me, this sometimes means pulling over multiple times just to make sure I’m still following it correctly, since Google is stubbornly trying to redirect me through a traffic jam. 3. When I compare it with my fiancé’s Apple Maps, the latter has proven to have better routes time and time again. 4. Doesn’t show current speed limit *not huge but it’d be great to have*. Needless to say, I’ll be testing the navigation app market to see if my complaints are fair or not.",0,
"iphone 6s ios 10. I get smooth performance for every app, except everything google now offers! Google maps has always been so much better than apple maps and all others as well. But all these 'Everyday' updates and bug fixes have made the app sluggish. I believe we all can live with a little less features if it means just getting that smoothness back! Almost 60% of the screen space is taken by all-that-i-don't-need when i open the app. i just need the map, my current location and my destination bar!! That's it! If we need anything else, or if you think we need anything else, then just give us those options in the side menu. You should realize that most people are still using those 5-6 inch devices and not the ipads. 40% screen is not good enough for the map! and yes, we can't all have an iphone X or a pixel 2 to just get rid with the laggy UI. Understand that you can't force us to buy devices we don't need, instead we will adapt to apple maps or something else if you can't be efficient.",0,
"I enjoy using this app! It’s great, but ever since the update for CarPlay, there have been a few issues. The most annoying thing is when driving, my position shows up upside down or even facing to the left of right. I understand this has to do with the way the phone GPS may be facing, but when driving on an expressway, it makes no sense. It shows the map as if I’m driving backwards. You guys should have a setting if you are moving in one direction at a certain speed to default the map to move to the way the road is. The whole map moving is only useful if you are walking. Another issue I ran into was the app freezes when you try to input an address via voice. This happens not as much but still bad. All in all, you guys need to make a setting to disable the actual location we’re facing when driving and just figure out if we’re going up, down, left, or right then make the map follow that. If this doesn’t get fixed, i honestly don’t know if I will continue to use this app.",0,
"Great app. I have a lot of good things to say about you guys. But at the very same time I’m beyond angry. There’s so many features you never bothered to consider or enable. I’ve got a very specific reason why I need to remove all my contributions from Google Maps. I was a Level 9 Local Guide but for reasons I won’t get into I need all my contributions gone. Of course you guys wanna make it difficult though. I have to MANUALLY REMOVE EVERY PHOTO. You guys never THOUGHT to implement a feature that allows you to mass-delete all your contributions. Hypothetically deleting my Google account wouldn’t even do me any justice, my contributions would remain. I’ve been sitting here for hours on end — 3.5 hours I think — and I’ve screen recorded all my progress — and I’ve only managed to delete 2,000 photos. It took me THAT long to manually delete 2k photos, and I’ve still got 7k to go. You guys have robbed me of my time because you never thought to implement such a simple feature.",0,
"Google maps was the best. It was google, and maps all in one (store hours, phone number, store website, and directions) I would get upset with people that didn’t use google maps over apple maps. However, over the last year it has become trash. New updates cause so many issues with just the basics of the app, it’s navigation. I will get ridiculously inflated estimated times of arrival for locations that are a mile or two away. The app will tell me to turn the wrong way down one-ways, always now, even though the app map has an arrow on the street clarifying that it is a one-way, it still says to turn down them the wrong way. The app has also told me to turn my car onto a bike/walking path and cut through a park to reach my destination. Google maps, once the best, has become dangerous. I keep hoping for it to be fixed, and it seems there are windows of time when it does work properly , but more often than not it is dangerous. Be aware and careful out there if you are using this app for navigation. It also pains me to have to write this review about what was such an important app on my phone",0,
"I use this very often, but a lot of the time when I select a specific route to take, later when I’m driving it will say “we have found a faster route, if you would like to stay on your current route click no thanks” and if you don’t click no thanks it will change the route you selected to something else. For one, just because a route may be slightly faster doesn’t mean it’s a road I’d prefer to be on, there can be many reasons for this. Second, I shouldn’t be forced to click a button on my phone screen while I’m driving just to stay on the route that I chose, that’s very distracting and illogical. It should be “we have found a faster route, if you would like to follow this route click ok”. Also why does it assume I didn’t see the faster route already and decided I didn’t want to go on that route beforehand, does it think I’m stupid or something? Please fix this, it’s very annoying and just makes me want to use a different maps app.",0,
"Google maps is always my “go-to” app for directions and traffic, but, it could be even better. My biggest gripe is that I can’t drag a route on the mobile app (on my iPhone) to get time or mileage estimates for a route I suspect will be better (because I KNOW my area’s traffic patterns-especially during rush hour times!) And choosing “avoid highways” or something else won’t help because I want a blend that includes both a )?highway then a back road. I love the drag feature on my desktop but why can’t it also be available on the mobile app? My next complaint is the inability to print directions directly from the app. My mother needs directions and being “older” (and without a smartphone, lol) she prefers having the  paper directions. If I want to do that for her, again, I have to boot up my laptop 😖 Please see if the app can incorporate these features that work so well on a desktop/laptop into the mobile app! 🙏",0,
"I have been using GPS in my vehicles since 2007, so I have dealt with a number of different systems for over ten years now, and I have spent lot of money on navigation systems installed in vehicles (eight different vehicles over that period). I still use a built-in system in my present vehicle. But increasingly—and since iPhone 5 and iPhone 6—I have been depending on Google Maps to route me to specific destinations, and using my car’s BlueTooth connection system to provide continuous directions through my car’s sound system. I have found it extremely reliable, and I certainly have appreciated that it is constantly updated and free. As most newer cars can connect with their owners’ smartphones now—and as most smartphones can be charged in the car—I highly recommend this application to everyone who has to do a lot of driving!",0,
"I’ve been using Google Maps for a while now, utilizing the ‘location sharing’ feature more than anything.  I’ve tried so hard to like the app and make it work for my family and I, but the app has let me down consistently! The location sharing feature often gives me inaccurate locations (of other family members sharing their location) or provides me with a MASSIVE range of possibilities of where family members are...too large of a range to even GUESS where their location could be.  However, with all those issues, I’ve still been using the app with hope that location accuracy will improve.  NOW, the location will not update! This has been an issue for almost a week now-I’ve had a location of each family member, but the location is anywhere from “2-4 hours ago”!! And the ‘refresh’ option will not ‘refresh.’ I’ve tried everything I can think of to fix the issue, thinking it could be something on my end or on family’s end, but to no avail.  Please fix this app!!",0,
"Google maps has been fantastic in regards to loading maps and not needing Cellular, Wi-Fi or Internet access of sort just like Waze works. The Waze app. is a great one for knowing what’s ahead of you and Waze will be route via satellite when you’re in different traffic situations such as traveling in Sicily as we are now and rerouting us through the back streets that he would never know they would exist to return to our destination in the middle of the night. I like the way Google maps marks out the route like a regular map but when I do need to change or use Waze, just to have something different. Google maps also has wonderful easy to read history another great features Such as locations of restaurants shops etc. what’s their gathering for Google Trips. It’s a beautiful package that Google is doing, and it works well and I have not seen any bugs with it.",0,
"The new update is terrible - instead of Explore, Driving and Transit, now there’s only two tabs: Explore and Commute. As someone with an irregular work schedule (work from home some days, no fixed time I come into and leave the office) it’s practically useless since the days/times aren’t customizable. And to make way for Commute, they took away the best feature of the app, the Transit tab. As a New Yorker, I had my app set to that as a default, because it would highlight all the subway lines in colors, show me where all of the entrances and exits were located and even the station layouts and positions of each platform. This is vital information here in NYC!! Why would you get rid of this? Now all I have is a useless Commute tab and an obnoxious Explore tab that I don’t use but is now apparently my new default. Oh, and once you set up commute, you can’t remove it. Found this out by accident when I was trying to figure out where the nearest subway line was (as it was no longer highlighted). Only way to remove it was to delete my work address. Google, please bring back Transit!!!",0,
"I switch back and forth between Maps and Google Maps. I’d like it if you would add a toggle to view the speed limit on route. I get nervous when traveling into new places, especially back roads, and not knowing the speed limit. I enjoy the turn by turn directions that include mention of a street or landmark to head towards - that is incredibly helpful when I am not familiar with the area. One thing I’d improve is how soon the audio function will remind you to make a turn or take an exit. Most of the time, I am reminded within a quarter mile, but sometimes I am reminded within 800 ft, and other times I am not reminded at all! I wondered if this is a function that could be fixed. I haven’t experienced any serious issues with the app, and other then what I have mentioned above there are no other suggestions I can currently think of! Thank you very much for your hard work/development of this app!",1,"Speed limits in navigation should be available in your country! Thank you for your patience as we roll this feature out. To use this feature (once it’s available to you) in the latest version of Google Maps just start driving navigation. In some locations, the maximum speed limit appears as a black and white box. In other locations, the maximum speed limit may appear as a red and white circle. You can learn more about this feature in this Google Maps Help Center article: https://support.google.com/maps/answer/3273406"
"I don’t know what y’all have done, but for the last month plus Google Maps has been absolutely awful! Inaccurate directions, plain old wrong directions, end points one to two streets over from the actual location, routes that are way off track from a direct route (regardless of traffic), the orientation of the map (biggest screw up you currently have going on!!!!!!!!)......who wants to know what north is on the map and if you’re heading south, my car shows me that....and so does the dang SUN! what I would like to see (as well as MANY other Google Map users, I’m sure!) is the “in time”, actual orientation that shows UP as forward. Half the time my music is turned up and I’m not listening to the audio, but rather looking at the map, and when a right turn goes to the left, guess where the human brain wants to turn......yep, LEFT. Whoever decided the recent updates you all have made, were good ideas.....must not drive for a living, travel regularly, or drive much at all outside of a 10 mile radius! FIX THIS CRAP!!!!!!!",0,
"I use this all the time when at my parents’ place and it gives me plenty of notice for a turn and does an overall great job navigating in New York. I’ve been using it while at my grandparents’ in West Cost US and it tells me once I’m at the turn that I’m supposed to be turning (at which point I can’t turn) and in Japan it doesn’t register where you are when trying to walk places and get directions, and we ended up making wrong turns because the map would say we were two blocks from where we actually were. Overall I use this over Apple Maps any day but it’s getting to be annoying missing turns because I can’t look at the map while driving and it tells me only once I’m at the turn to actually turn. If I was more familiar with the area it wouldn’t be a problem but I’m only here about 1 week every year and I only just started driving here because I can’t rent a car so I have to be able to borrow a car.",0,
"I almost never give “bad”reviews of something but I felt like I needed to share. I started using Google Maps more because I have been using lots of other Google apps and loved them like docs, tasks, calendar, etc. I liked them better than the Apple versions. So I gave google Maps a try on a recent weekend trip. I knew which highway I needed to use but I needed help closer to my destination. It seemed to be experiencing some kind of error. It kept telling me to turn somewhere not the usual once or twice reminder but repeatedly for a solid minute and a half. So I ignored it, got myself to the highway I knew I needed to be on and figured it would reroute or correct but it kept doing it! I had to have Siri download another directions app and use that while I was driving because this app couldn’t get it together. I thought surely, I had selected some sort of setting that made it do that but I haven’t found anything unusual. I’m a little nervous to use it again, honestly.",0,
"Love that I can save places to lists, and show and hide each list from the general-purpose map. However, it is extremely frustrating that there is no way to go into a list and (only then, while viewing that list) temporarily see all the places I saved to that list on the map without having to do this: - tell the app to show them in the map - return to the map - try to pick them out amongst everything else I saved (unless I also manually go turn off those lists temporarily, which isn’t worth the trouble for 99% of the use cases I’m suggesting) In other words, unless I’ve missed something, you can only see lists in list view unless you adjust their visibility as bookmarks on your map. I don’t want that- I just want a way to see the list on the map through the list itself and then go back to the map with all my other settings unchanged. For example, some lists (like places to eat) I would like to always display on a daily basis. I leave those turned on. Other lists (like museums) I only get to use occasionally, so usually leave turned off so the map isn’t too crowded. That’s all fine. I get annoyed, however, when I go to the museums list, and want to quickly view only museums in the map, but cannot; to do so, I have to turn on that list and turn off 3-5 other normal lists first. This seems unnecessary and easy to fix, and would add a ton of  utility to an otherwise good app.",0,
"In recent months this app has become worthless for getting anywhere. It says that my destination is several hours away when it is really only 20 to 25 minutes away. It at times does not recognize that I am driving on a highway with no exit in sight and it will say to turn on to a street that is off the highway. On city streets it will say to turn where there is a city water control drainage ditch separating me from the street it is saying to turn on to.  It will sometimes take me in the opposite direction from my desired destination.  It will say to turn on to a street that is blocked by a concrete median.  Today it was taking along a route and was saying to continue on to another street, I noticed that I was about to pass through the intersection of the street with the address of my destination. As I drove up to the address of my destination the application was still giving my directions to drive the opposite way. I am removing this app from my iPhone and going back to using MapQuest. At least I will get where my destination is without having to stop to ask directions.",0,
"I’d give this a middle finger emoji if it would let me. Google Maps is terrible. Why it’s “the number one navigation app” is beyond me. Today was the last straw. Traveling east from DC into Massachusetts - encountered a “twenty minute slowdown ahead” on the GW Bridge (in NYC) - 25 miles from where I presently was (plenty of time to redirect me). Google just kept informing me of the slowdown and how much longer it was getting (now, two hours) and happily steaming me along INTO IT. Desperate to avoid sitting on the GW in NYC for 2+ hours (after already driving for 8 with 3+ more to go) I opened Waze. *WAZE* immediately redirected me, getting me to my destination and saving me a needless 2+ additional hours in my vehicle. Google - PRO TIP: When offering a “navigation” tool, the people using it want the QUICKEST, most EFFICIENT way to their destination. They don’t want their lives disrupted further. I had to make an 8 hour drive today. Google Maps would have made that 11+ *for no reason.* This is not an isolated incident. Me? I’d avoid the app, unless you enjoy not being re-routed to the most efficient routes available. Very bummed out.",0,
"What happened to this product? So frustrating and flawed now and it’s kinda hard to believe given how many dev resources you have. Navigation is always buggy now, deep linking stopped working so I can’t send someone directions and have them open the app even though it’s installed. The app audio interruptions are terrible and don’t properly pause other audio streams coming from my device. App says I’m offline when Apple maps and other apps are working perfectly fine. What gives? On top of that your core algorithm for directions and tracking works terribly in SoCal now...constantly routing me around in circles on certain highways. Edit: A new infuriating bug. Every time I open the app from the background on an iPhone X, iOS 11 device, I get the offline, tap to retry message that never actually retries the network connection (possibly going from WiFi to cell connection). I have to kill the app from memory and relaunch the app. This is seriously a risk to users who are driving and relying on this simple network handling. Simple stuff y’all.",0,
"I hate using this map because it always gives me the wrong directions. I live in Houston Texas and for some reason the map always stops and starts floating mid air. It glitches while giving directions and repeats things over 20x. I have the X, I even visited the apply store to see if it was user error. But no...it’s crappy google map. It’s only good for the “avoid tolls” option. But even that STILL puts me on a tollway. I’ve been late using this app because it always gives the wrong, longest routes. I’ve been lost using this map, run out of gas. I only open it to have a backup map just in case Waze decides to glitch...google map has been around for far to long to have problems like this. And from my memory...it wasn’t always this bad. I used to scream yooo use google map! Now I’m like “you got the waze app? It shows police.” Cmon google! Where’s the accurate maps? Directions? Speed limit compared to the speed limit in my city? Where’s my police radar? Where’s my option to send my ETA? I’m no app builder but I just expected so much more from a google run app.",0,
It needs to have an option when there is traffic to alert you soon enough for you to make a decision to take the detour. Also Google maps needs to work on their notification when using the GPS. Google maps tells you way ahead of time that you’re going to turn right but you have to keep looking at the app to make sure you don’t miss the road. Google should alert the driver when they get to the road exactly and make a noise like ding ding turn right here.  I passed roads many times because one Google maps doesn’t tell you on the bottom of your screen what road you’re on and on the top it should say what your next move will be With the roads name that you’re turning onto. Just my opinion otherwise it’s a great app I love it don’t use anything else not even that iPhone maps that came with it.,0,
"I absolutely love this app! Arguably, my favorite app. At first, I only used this app because I thought it was a better alternative for GPS, however as I began to explore the app I began to really love it. A few years ago, I became a local guide because I was I wanted to pass time and write a few reviews. Now, I can’t stop! I love it, I really feel like I make a difference in my community. I can see people interacting with my reviews and my photos. I can save places that I like or frequently go to like, work, home or even custom places. Through Bluetooth I’m able to see where my car is parked. At the end of the day I can even check my timeline to see where the day has taken me (I love that because I drive everywhere for work). To the developers, you are really doing a great job and I appreciate your hard work. Thank you!",0,
"Google reviews are well known throughout the country for making sure that ex employees, competitors, and other trolls,  do NOT destroy your professional reputation with hateful content, and derogatory remarks. I’m very grateful that Google reviews and Google maps takes businesses reputations seriously, and there is no other company that does this as well. Google reviews are not cheaters like yelp, where yelp blackmails and manufactures bad reviews of a business, in order to force the business owner into paying yelp money every month in order to remove the bad reviews that they manufactured. Most any other reviewers black mail the small businesses, and ONLY GOOGLE REVIEWS DO NOT TRY TO DESTROY The American small business owner. Thank you so much Google reviews for not allowing fired ex-employees, competitors, and other trolls to ruin my small business.",0,
"Google Maps have certainly helped my New Years resolution of being on-time!!! Google maps not only give you the precise turn by turn directions, announcing or on silence, to the imputed address. If you do not have the address, just type in the name and Google maps will do all the research for you to get you the exact address. Not only the exact address, however, the approximate time of your arrival. Google maps, usually , if not, always, gives you several different routes to choose from to get to your designated address. It has the option to announce the turn by turn directions and/or to be silent, while still offering turn by turn directions. I heavily rely on Google Maps just about everyday and thus far, I’m sticking with my “New Years” resolution of being on time !!!! Thank you very much, Google Maps",0,

"When it comes to getting you to rent the apartment the staff is incredible. However once you are renting the apartment should you run into any maintenance problems, forget about it !!!!!!! I currently live here and I have a leak in the master bathroom ceiling for OVER A MONTH !!!!! They came to look at it. Placed a piece of card board and tape over it and said they would come back to fix the leak issue and DID NOT RETURN FOR OVER A MONTH! I have made plenty of request, called the office multiple times to only come home and have the leak still happening in the bathroom and not being able to shower. I make a point to pay my rent on time, to make sure my family does cause any disturbance to the neighbors, to make sure we are good neighbors. So when you are charging me $1,800 for a 2/2 I except AT THE LEAST for when I call in A LEAK IN THE CEILING for it to be resolved the same week. I have been more than understanding and more than patient but I am extremely disappointed with the neighborhood!!!! Not how I thought this community operated, extremely dissatisfied, cannot wait for lease to be up!",0,
"I love this app more than any other nav app without question. The fact that I can add unlimited stops and navigate turn by turn in satellite view is amazing for my job as a delivery driver. Traffic info is the most accurate I’ve found and the ability to correct errors on the map such as address locations and road closures is priceless. The one feature it’s missing that I would love to see in the near future is the ability to have building outlines show up (preferably popped out) in the turn by turn navigation like they do while exploring the map outside of navigation. As it is, only the roads appear and no buildings. Other than that it’s a 5 star app but this one quirk makes it unfortunately 4 stars. Give me the option to show buildings while in navigation and 5 stars all the way!",0,
"The Google Maps app is truly a great app and it keeps getting better. My two and ultimate, well three of them, wishes and improvements are: 1: Allow us to terminate/cancel a navigation session or route by swiping down and 3D touching on the direction notification. Currently we have to open the app and go terminate it there. It would be much simpler, easier, and Safer if we could simply swipe down or 3D Touch on the notification and stop/cancel the route. 2: Allow us to pause navigation guidance. Sometimes I just want to stop and do something that I had previously not thought of. It would be nice to be able to pause the guidance rather than the app constantly reloading and trying to get me back on the route. Maybe allow that also to happen with a swipe of 3D touch on the notification banner. 3: Lastly, it would be truly amazing if the notification banner was to become reacher and more interactive. For example, in addition to the quick features proposed above, if the notification banner by being activated could show a mini animated version of the map so that the user can see from that screen their position, rather than having to go inside the app that would be amazing. That’s all I have. Thanks folks; great job as usual. Best regards,",0,
"My husband was an over the road trucker. The company got a contract that brought the trucks to a few out of the way farms with low and underweight bridges when this was first available. I’d get home from work, sit at the computer and drive the new routes at street level (which was better than the new street level) before he’d have to get off the highway. Saw a few lovely weddings, people waved to the google car after noticing its gizmo on the roof too. I could reroute him around ‘no trucks allowed’, 10’ bridge ahead’, ‘weight limit 5000 lbs!’ And to safe rest areas. He’s retired, so now we have fun setting, even routes we know well, and google tells us turn by turn. Our daughter shook her head and rolled her eyes...until she got lost and I told her to try it. She calmed right down as it guided her back to the road she knew.  Thank you Google!",0,
"For months I’ve been getting unwanted visitors. Couldn’t figure out why until someone finally told me where they where trying get to. Turns out I t’s a resort 2 miles away. The resort contacted Google and (we thought) fixed their location. Then tonight at 11:30 pm a car is sitting in my driveway for 5 min. I go out with the shotgun to see what’s what. Turns out that they entered the physical address of that resort and it sent them here. So even though Google changed the business location they didn’t change the location of the address. Though I guess it isn’t all Google’s fault. These tourists turned at my mailbox with 3 sets of reflective house numbers (300 lower than the address they were looking for) then while driving 1/2 mile up my rutted, steep, dirt driveway passed 3 No Trespassing signs to then sit 6 feet from my house to call the resort for their address at 2330 waking up the whole house. While I live tourism because it is the life blood of the region. I don’t live in the middle of 100 forested acres, half a mile up a mountain, because I want them to visit me personally.",0,
"I use the app for navigation a lot. Like a lot a lot, and the update is cosmetically great but it’s hidden some settings the I prefer to always be on and doesn’t remember them when you restart the app. Like showing traffic for roads not along the path you’re navigating. You have to tap the weird layer icon in the top right. That small peeve aside, in the commute tab, you can’t pull the fastest route suggestions down to see the map on more than 25% of your screen until you commit (press start) to one - which is the biggest nuisance for me. So you can swivel and zoom but only see the information you want through 25% of the screen before committing to a selected route. Hope they adjust that soon. I kind of get it that your commute isn’t going to change much but what’s the harm in letting me see the bigger map before committing to a route?",0,
"Before this most recent update, this used to be great. I preferred the previous version. I liked having my commute and most frequent travel destinations on the “home page,” so that I could easily select where I’m going. I liked seeing how many miles each route would take, as well as how many minutes for each option. I liked having more than 2 options, since I’m in Suburbia and have several routes I can take, I could see what was the best option given traffic in a given day. I’m not a fan of the Explore option on my home page - if I want to explore, I’ll ask what’s around me. I hear that video ads and auto play videos are soon to be a thing, which is why I stopped using Waze. I am already inundated with advertising on a daily basis, can’t I just drive to work safely without hearing about what else people want me to spend my money on? Used to be at least a 4 star app, taking it down to 2 due to the updates and impending consumer marketing overload.",0,
"I think this app is definitely number one for maps. I can look anywhere as long as I have Wi-Fi and the quality of the images is pretty good as well, unless you zoom in too much. I love to look at glaciers on mountains like the Himalayas or the Cascades. I also like how there are some bike trails you show. Right now as i’m writing this review were covered in 2 feet of snow, so it’s pointless in winter, (unless you get no snow) but in summer it’s pretty useful. It also helps me out with geography, which is a subject I study a lot. Finally I like looking in on river valleys. It’s really easy to scroll down a river valley and see where it leads to. My only suggestion is that you could add the other planets and moons of the solar system (please include Pluto if you do). Anyway this is super great for navigation and definitely deserves 5 stars. ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️",0,
"I like to use Google map, even I am using an  iPhone. Few days ago, I need drive to a nearby school about a mile away. After a few minutes diving, I noticed I am in the walking route, I stopped the car and changes back to drive setting. I am lucky because it happens close to my home. Yesterday I was not that lucky, I was in San Diego,  A city I didn't know very well. I found a restaurant nearby, after following Google map drive a while, my kids started to cry, we are in a very narrow bike ride in the middle of trees and grass. Then I checked the setting, Google automatically changes to biking from driving again. Luckily for us, we came out safely after 30 minutes of struggles, I close my Google map and turn on the GPS in my Car, it knows that I am driving a big SUV  :( Please let me know ahead if any setting needs to change.",0,
"However, waze has a leg up when it comes to reporting hazards and speed enforcement. For instance I love that I can now report vehicles on the shoulder, objects on the road, and speed traps, BUT I can’t thumb up or down other peoples reports. It mighty seem like a small thing, but that one interactive feature (along with an audible announcement) puts waze above google maps for most of my family and friends. It would be more user friendly if a banner popped up with upcoming reports along with a thumb up/down option. Also, why titled “speed trap?” Why not just “police?” Or to be more general “speed enforcement,” which would include both cops and speed devices. Also could there be an option for bad weather or road conditions? These are my thoughts for an update. Google maps is still my favorite navigation app and I defend it to my waze-loving family.",0,
"I want to use google maps to plan a trip and find places we want to visit. I used to be able to find a place and label it with an icon. For example a restaurant could be marked with a knife and fork icon, while my home could have a house icon. Seems pretty simple. Then I could share the map, with all its pins with my husband, and he could click on the knife and fork to see the restaurant I had marked. If he clicked on it there would be all the relevant info with links about said restaurant. I’m not sure what happened to google maps but all these functions have gone away. I’m able to create a list but every item gets a flag. Those flags are identical and therefore useless. We’re headed to London and between restaurants and museums and sites the share map is useless. It is a giant confusing pin cushion! Why have they taken away simple functions! And then adding to my frustration, there is no support whatsoever from Google. Just a community forum where everyone just commiserates about the same issues. Terrible.",1,"Thanks for the review.

"I love / hate this app. It’s great because of all its features but after a couple uses it goes bad on you. I’ll start my navigation and all of a sudden the arrow that points in the way I’m headed flips on me and shows me in either the opposite direction or that I’m going left or something unhelpful like that. This “feature” or glitch as I would call it, is SUPER ANNOYING and unhelpful because now when I have to make a left or right I have to grab my phone while I’m driving and turn it to see the actual way I’m supposed to be driving or I have to take multiple looks at the screen just to figure out which way I’m supposed to go which is annoying. I have my screen locked so it’s not like the phone is turned sideways or something that the arrow should be turning. Please make it so the app only point forward and not any other way. I love using this app when I first download it because it doesn’t do this then I end up deleting it because it ends up doing this. Thanks!",0,
"This mapping service is far superior than Apple’s built in one. All I see is them playing catch up with iOS 12 compared to the higher rated alternatives, but haven’t been all that reliable. I always use this app for navigation. One issue I’ve had with the app is the offline mode. It’s a fantastic feature to have without cellular or a leftover phone you don’t use anymore. But I hate the fact that you can only download a certain portion of the area you’re around. I could download more areas, but it’s rather a pain always getting a notification saying I need to update each and every one of those areas. I’ve seen other map apps download the whole U.S., and sometimes the whole world. I feel with the best navigation app, it deserves a feature like this. Please make it happen!",0,
"Having owned just about every major mobile OS of the past decade, I've used practically all navigation apps. Google maps for me is the most reliable (thought sometimes they make mistakes), with the best features. Adding a waypoint (i.e. stop for coffee or gas) and the ability to add destinations based off your calendar or web searches is great albeit a little creepy too What sets Google maps apart is the incredible search function. I almost always find what I'm looking for. I'm not taking about a larger store or famous restaurant; I mean small companies that I need to travel to for work. Somewhere next to no one would need to know about. It's that good. My biggest compliment is the lack of speed limits while using the app. I have carplay and I never see speed limits. There's an option to add which is enabled but nothing on my screen. Once fixed it's a 5 star for sure.",0,
I was excited to finally be able to use Google Maps on CarPlay instead of Apple’s Maps app. But I have to say the CarPlay version of Google Maps is not as clean as Apple’s Maps. It is great that Google gives me more advance time to make a turn. Maps was almost dangerously late. One thing Google should add is the speed limit. Both Maps and Waze have this. Choosing destinations is clumsy. Why not have a way to go directly to favorites? The automatic change from daytime to nighttime does not always work. Sometimes for no reason the voice is from the iPhone and not CarPlay.  The volume setting is not consistent. It can be too loud and I change to normal and then soft but still too loud. Now I have it on loudest and it is fine but I keep waiting for it to be painfully loud. The microphone only works sometimes. I suspect that Google will address bugs now that it is on CarPlay. Waze is also buggy and I’m hoping that Google will address bugs there as well.,1,"Speed limits in navigation should be available in your country! Thank you for your patience as we roll this feature out. To use this feature (once it’s available to you) in the latest version of Google Maps just start driving navigation. In some locations, the maximum speed limit appears as a black and white box. In other locations, the maximum speed limit may appear as a red and white circle.

"This is by far my favorite app for navigation. My only issues with it have been that its routs don't show construction (my area has a road that's been routed one-way for a stretch because of construction) and despite this, Google maps still routs traffic through the one-way street… going the wrong way. Obviously this is very minor as I'm sure it would recalculate the rout once you start the detour, but seeing areas with construction (and knowing it needs to detour) would be a plus. Other complaint? The bottom ""explore places"" bar always popping up and loading. While I might use that at some point, for now it's just a screen hog and a distraction that I cannot disable. Even with these minor annoyances, I cannot really see myself swapping to any other mapping service; there's just too much that Google does right, and usually excellently at that.",0,
"I used to enjoy Google Maps until I was driving, and the app asked me to OPT OUT of the route I chose because it found a “faster route” for me. So by the time I had moment to spare away from DRIVING, I tried to cancel the route change, but I was too late. So I missed the route I originally chose at the beginning of my trip and had to pull over to re-navigate myself back on my originally chosen route. I tried to look for a setting to opt me out of this feature, but it is not available. I appreciate Google informing me of a faster route, but there are times when I choose a slower route for many different reasons. Most of the available routes are provided when I’m pulling the directions up, so I wish the navigation would stay on the option I ALREADY CHOSE before I started driving! Sometimes, I want a change of scenery. Sometimes, I want to take the roads I have always taken. Sometimes, I can’t even drive the speed limit on the “faster” highway because I’m towing a trailer. So when google claimed the highway was a “faster route with a sooner eta” it was false, because there is no option to set my own maximum speed (for example, 55mph in CA where it is required to drive at 55 while towing a trailer). I would use this app again IF it would navigate me on my SELECTED route, and then ask the user if I would like to change routes to avoid traffic or an accident. Until then, I will have to use the basic Apple Maps provided on my phone.",0,
"I am really bad at directions, a lot has to do with my high anxiety levels at times. Especially times when I’m driving to a new place and make a wrong turn and then another wrong turn. Currently I am in the Estate Sale business and am in a new location weekly, and all I have to go on is the address. I have tried different map sites and I swear to you they have gotten me so lost, so many times. I have been late, ready to just turn around and go home In tears because I’m lost. I recently found google maps, I love the satellite feature, and I haven’t been lost ever since! Google maps is awesome I love it, if there is something wrong ahead of me it’ll reroute me and most of the time I don’t even realize it. Google maps gets me to my destination and I can’t live without it...!!! Thank you ....",0,
"This app is truly amazing way better than apple maps and anything else, but it could use a change. I wish there was a create a route option.  For example there are routes that people like to take which google will not recognize since they recognize quick routes or routes based on your location, but there should be an option where you can save create a route and adjust where you turn and what streets you take and allow us to be able to save it. There are certain routes where my girlfriend is comfortable taking to get to school, they aren’t busy roads and she likes that and she is most comfortable with those. At times she gets lost she misses a turn or takes the wrong one, which is why I’d like to propose this solution/ add on because I know others have faced something like this. Thank you google",0,
"I have been going to the paint and sip classes at Greene Eagle for about two years. My special needs nephew goes with me often. The instructor ,Deb, is so patient and helpful not only with my nephew but with everyone. So far all of the projects have been a lot of fun and I have met some really nice fellow painters. We attend these classes about once a month so I have had a lot of opportunity to sample menu items. Everything has been very good. In fact I always bring a cheese plate home to snack on later.

"The navigation is awesome except for a few easily fixable bugs. My only inconvenience is that they integrated the Google Assistant into the app, and it doesn’t exactly work well. The Assistant takes forever to understand your voice, even longer to complete your request, and still only actually completes very simple actions, with major audio breaks in one response. If you’re going to integrate a valuable feature that the company usually is very good with, just try to do it right. Also, the other glitch I’ve noticed is location sharing. While on a route, I’ve attempted to share my location with others through messages and they’ve been unsuccessful in seeing my location after being redirected to the Google Maps app after clicking the link I have sent them. Keep up the good work and try to fix the bugs.",0,
"Literally be lost without it. I’m a delivery driver for a restaurant that has a very wide delivery zone, even going into very rural and dark areas. What this app provides is the most accurate directions to the home I’m trying to locate. When I’m on the street looking for an address that is in an obscure location or non-existent the arrow on the app will keep moving along with me until I’m exactly where the home is. Last Winter, I couldn’t physically see some of the houses because of the blowing snow and the fact they were 75 to 100 yards off the road or behind trees yet this app located them for me. I’ve tried other apps but none provide the accuracy this one does. Sure it has its little bugs but Google seems to fix them right away but never had any serious issues with it!!",0,
Way back in the day when Google was just trying help us find directions this was a five star app. Then Apple and Google realized they weren't milking every dollar out of each other  and started the slow decline in app quality. Instead of offering multiple ways to get to your destination it now gives you the fastest. But if there is traffic it will re route automatically without permission. It also doesn't always take you the fast way. Sometimes it takes you   through town  for no reason because it wants to stop and shop. Doesn't show all restaurants and fast food. It used to show you the whole map when you were driving now twenty feet before you are supposed to turn it will tell you and then it slowly shows up. I hate it. Haven't heard of a better directions app so we are stuck with this crap.,0,
"I use google maps everyday for many things. This week was the first time I needed to use it to plan out and navigate a long drive through some remote areas and it definitely disappointed. I drove from Denver CO to Saskatoon Canada. That is 1,000 miles through some very remote areas of Wyoming and Montana. Before the trip I attempted to find gas stations so I don’t get stuck between towns . Google showed me stations along the route, but only close to my current location. So I couldn’t use it to plan ahead. In Montana, we suddenly hit a dirt road, which we were on for about 50 miles. If we weren’t in an SUV, that would have cost us 3-4 hours in detours. It didn’t know about quite a few gas stations, service areas and truck stops and some that were on the map, weren’t there at all. To summarize, use Google maps in populated areas. Do not trust it for long trips away from major highways and metro areas.",0,
"Google maps has been the best gps I’ve tried and have continued to use it, one thing people have told me that they enjoy about Apple maps and waze is that those apps have a speed limit placed on the interface itself and that enjoy that feature because speed limit signs aren’t always posted and it’s just another precaution, if google maps could somehow incorporate that feature into their app I believe it would help not only sway more user towards google maps but it could also help prevent accidents for drivers who are assuming the speed limit instead of being sure, it would be a safe but very useful feature to have a speed limit on the screen. I have no problems with speeding but I believe this would really help improve driving and user satisfaction.",1,"Speed limits in navigation should be available in your country!

"I have a big screen in my car, but most of the in-app navigation is on the right side of the screen while the left has big clunky directions instead of the flat clean design like the phone app. The map doesn't show a lot of street names unless I am really zoomed out. Also, touching an alternative route while navigating doesn't seem to work. I have to either cancel the route and start navigation again or start on the alternate route and hope that the app doesn't accidentally redirect me back. Might be helpful if the zoom controls permanently stay on screen. Overall, it's quite good and I had been waiting for this update since I got my car, I just wish it wasn't so much like Apple Maps.

"I use Google Maps for work, using it to get to my patient’s houses to do home care. Normally I’m very happy with the app, but suddenly it’s asking me to rate how happy I am with the app at the exact moment I’m arriving... if the address is down the street, fine - I have a chance to memorize the house number before google wants to be rated, but often, the address I’m looking for is immediately on the last turn, so google asks for a rating before it’s even given me the address, leaving me absolutely stuck! I have to pull over so I can go back and look at the exact address I’m looking for. I’m sorry, but rating google at that moment is not my primary interest, but finding the address is! If I rate it at that moment, I’ll give a zero out of sheer frustration! Do I need to use a different app for navigation all the way to my final destination??? Please tell me how to opt out of rating - I want to rate at my own convenience and choice, not google’s!",0,
"There was a time when Google maps had really helpful settings where you could set your commute route, which for people talking public transit is VERY helpful. I used this feature everyday until it was gone. Now Google maps actively works against getting me to work on time. Instead of a being able to set a route it will choose any train going out of the major city I am in extending my actual route by on average an hour and inaccurately. If you need this to commute use any other public transit app, google will not learn your commute and will make it much harder. If they go back to allowing users to set a route it would become the best travel app, but they eliminated the only feature I used and made the whole this useless and frustrating. It won’t even let me set my commute to be from my home to work, I can check future times unless you am in my home, which obviously does not help me plan to get to work. Google was the best and made themselves the worst, DO NOT RELY ON THIS SERVICE IT WILL LET YOU DOWN",0,
"Cause if you ever noticed your ETA climbing, ask yourself why that is. It’s because Google maps no longer actually routes you the fastest direction anymore. I don’t know what they changed in their algorithm, but since they changed it there has been a noticeable uptick in Los Angeles traffic. Everyone I know who uses Google maps has said that it it took a nose dive recently. In the stupid thing is, whenever you bring this up with support, they always say that traffic is unpredictable and they do the best they can. The only problem with this, is that if the traffic was truly unpredictable, then why does the ETA always go up, and never down? It’s because their algorithms VASTLY underestimate traffic. Their algorithms are what is off here. I’ve been using google maps for years and it’s only been in the past several months it’s turned into probably the most frustrating thing I’ve ever had to deal with. I don’t even want an ETA anymore. It’s useless. Why have an eta if you’re always just going to show up 10 minutes late to everything anyways? At what point will the “Traffic is heavier than usual” traffic become normal since it says that every SINGLE time I go anywhere. I don’t know what their issue is around Los Angeles but there are tons of reddit posts that are full of people asking why Google Maps has recently crapped their bed.

"Google Maps just released a new update, and per usual it only made the app worse, but this time I don’t think I can forgive the devs, because they took away the feature that I used several times a day. They took away streetview. Now, streetview does still exist on the app, but you can only access it from clicking on a business. You used to be able to hold down your finger on any street and it will pin it, and then give an option to go into streetview on that specific street. Well that doesn’t exist anymore, and I’d really like to know why, because it just does not make sense to get rid of that. I would use streetview to explore areas that I was getting ready to visit, it was a very useful tool for me, and now it has become pretty much unusable because I can only use it if there is a nearby business that I can click on. Google Maps is the only app I know that is progressively getting worse with each new update; like what’s next, getting rid of the navigation feature?",1,"Thanks for the review.

"The google maps app is great but there are always times where the directions are silent where a freeway may split, and the directions aren’t clear enough as to which direction to continue. This would be helpful to avoid last minute lane changes. As an iPhone X user, this app is currently terrible on this, and just because of that, I find myself going back to Waze and Apple maps. Waze, is definitely ahead of google in regards to on road obstacles, traffic and finding those shorter routes but google maps is far more directive with lane guidance etc. Because this app is missing a much needed update to support iPhone X, this is my main reason for giving the app a 3 star rating. I wouldn’t have expected google to be so far behind such a large rollout as the iPhone X considering other companies have already provided sufficient updates, including Waze.",0,
"Our school bus driver was taking us to school and used iOS maps. When we finally broke down because iOS maps was going insane by saying turn right then turn right): go north then immediately turn right): turn left then turn right): turn right then turn right): it was insanity.

We then downloaded Google maps and started using it. Then we found our way to school in less than five minutes. So whenever now I need directions, Google maps is always the app that I use.

"This mobile map is by far the best next to my Magellan. Apple maps blows. Apple maps uses google maps but the interface is so flawed. Google maps has never let me down. No map app is perfect, but google is by far the best all around; and all other maps uses google maps but has a different interface. People deleting the app cause it didn’t have accident or roads closed updated is silly. None of them are truly accurate on that anyway. If the app gets you close and you can’t figure out the rest of the address, then you shouldn’t be driving. I remember when I used Rand McNally paper maps and found my way around just fine.

"I use it almost everyday and I love updating the map that’s adding new places that does not exist on the map, making amendment to the existing ones and adding images. My concern is that some approvals takes a very long time and I will like to know why that’s the case because after adding a new place I will need it to be approved before adding the pictures I took of the place. When this takes a very long time I end up losing trace of the pictures I took to be updated on the map. I will also like to suggest if a search can be included in the edit area to help go through the items there quickly. I will like to know when video uploads will be available on iOS.

"I generally prefer Google Maps to other apps. I’m really frustrated by the latest update though. The new commute feature doesn’t do much in the way of convenience. My work hours vary and sometimes it doesn’t know if I’m headed home or to work- Hello? You’re a travel app, use the GPS? Plus, the commute screen has so much clutter on it that I can’t see the highlighted route clearly because it’s so small. I don’t want to have to hit “Start” and then zoom out/in in order to see the suggested route. Also, I really liked the old feature that showed locations from upcoming calendar events onscreen. For instance, if I opened the app at 4 and had a 4:30 doctor appointment, there was a shortcut to directions to the doctor. That seems to be gone now, which is really unfortunate. I think that’s more convenient than the two locations that I’m used to traveling to/from everyday.",0,
"This use to be a very good navigation app.  It has become a very scary and dangerous app. I am traveling in a 43’ motorhome towing a car.  I do not like it when the app changes my route because I couldn’t take my eyes off the road to hit the dismiss button.  Instead of me having to dismiss the route or it changes automatically, you should have an accept button if you want the change.  Why would you change a route to save a 1/2 mile weaving in a questionable neighborhood with a half dozen unnecessary turns adding time to the trip because of the slower speed zones just to come back out on to the same road It makes no sense at all!!!!  The streets in a neighborhood are smaller, narrow and not fit to drive a 43’ long, 8.5’ wide motorhome towing a car.  WHAT ARE YOU THINKING taking through traffic into neighborhoods????  Not only dangerous and inconvenient for the driver but what about the people who live there???  You are putting children at risk with the increase traffic. Also after the last update I lost all the flags and labels I spent hours putting on the map so I could just open the map and tap the flag for my next destination.  I had months worth of travel flagged and now it’s gone...what a waste!!!!! I am sorry to say that I am changing navigation apps...you have put me at risk one to many times in scary places that I did not need to be.

"Usually love google maps. However, I feel with the updates lately there have been a lot of glitches.  It’ll either freeze when using the gps, start showing that my car is completely off course when I had been driving on the same road it had told me to, or telling me to head toward a certain street where I have no clue where that street maybe.  I do like being able to make lists of different places to go/ things to do. However, again it’s difficult to update those lists bc it constantly freezes. It doesn’t let you delete places from your list bc it’s constantly freezing which is annoying!!!!  I have to keep going back into the app to unfreeze it. The ones I thought were deleted are still in there. Still going to use it and continue to use the Apple bc I dislike Apple Maps but just wish the glitches would get worked out.",0,
"I’ve used this app for years across multiple devices and it has done a great job of navigation and detouring me around bad traffic. But, this current version has rendered it unusable for me and it’s very disappointing. It’s been going on for a couple weeks now. The app just won’t work, it freezes and crashes. Sometimes it starts off normal and starts navigation but if I choose to look up directions to know my turns ahead of time it’ll freeze and crash. This morning is wet and sleet so I really need to know what roads are doing the worse, it wouldn’t pull up the map at all. It showed the dot where I’m located and no map details and completely froze without ever fully coming on. As it stands, this app is completely unusable for me at the moment. I hope this gets fixed soon because I really used it a lot. I currently have the latest ios13 and am using iphone 6S, if that helps to better figure out the problem.",0,
This app has worked flawless for me personally in the past. Most recently after an IOS update there has been a major issue. While using Google search I have found a major problem. After searching a place of interest the site pops up with the option to call go to website or directions using Google maps. But after clicking the directions button I am taken to the Google map app where it only shows my current location. The same happens when Googling an actual address as well as clicking on the physical address. Im my opinion this completely defeats the purpose of using the Google maps. If I have to look up then open and type the address myself one would find using the standard GPS with Iphone would suffice.  Maybe I am doing something wrong although this has only been an issue since the last update.,0,
"If you need to visit the bellevue/Redmond/Kirkland area, find another app.  Google gives you the longest route to any destination- even one half a mile down the street- without an option for another.  I've had it tell me to literally make circles within the same street.  Half of the time- it gets the destination wrong- to the point of being in another state.  For example, I was searching for a DMV in Redmond, WA.  They tried to send me to Redmond, Oregon.  The irony of this all is?  GOOGLE HAS AN OFFICE IN KIRKLAND, WA!  GOOGLE can't properly route its way through its own back yard!!!  So I use the map it gives me to find another route around- and usually, a better one.  I also hate the first step being ""go west/east/north/south to this area"".   If I'm new to an area or confused, I'm not gonna know which way that would be.  Plus, there is only ONE toll road on the east side- westbound 520.   I turned on 'avoid tolls', and google STILL routes me onto west 520.  It's the only toll bridge in google's backyard.

"I've used this app for years on my old iPhone 6 and it's always been reliable when I drive. Then I traded the iPhone 6 for an iPhone 8, and this app was the first app I opened because I needed directions on how to drive home. It directed me to take an exit off the highway. Then it directed me to get BACK on the highway I had just exited (one of those highways that combines exit ramps with on-ramps then merges the ramps back onto the highway). Then it had me EXIT the highway taking an exit that was completely not the right exit, only to turn around on the overpass and get back ONTO the same highway going in the opposite direction. This was completely unnecessary and added miles to my trip. And in the middle of turning around on the overpass, it freaks out and re-calculates for no reason. My suspicion is that somehow, Google Maps was very sensitive to bumps in the road and was re-calculating at the slightest jolt to the iPhone (which was mounted securely on a phone stand). Very frustrating experience though.",0,
"I love the responsiveness of this app after so many different updates available to enhance performance and experience. I would highly recommend this app for checking more transit locations than on the default Apple Maps but they are both great applications as a whole. Google Maps is overall very responsive even on devices that are considered obsolete which is truly awesome because it's always cool to know that an application can be backwards compatible even if it is slow. To conclude, Google Maps is an overall awesome app to find quick locations near you and cater your likes with suggestions at times which is smart and intuitive. The plethora of features available is amazing and I am ready for more updates!",0,
"Someone recommended that I use Waze because depending on traffic conditions, it will get you there a bit faster. I never tried it because I would go nuts if there is a change of route everytime I would use it just because there is a faster way than the usual. I generally can’t stand navigators there is always some annoying factor to it. This one has been very consistent and even if you insist on going the usual route, it will let you know if there is either traffic or construction by the yellow and red on sections of the mapped route. It does let you know of a better way and you can either ignore it or decline it and I love that part. If I know there construction going on ahead of me I will agree to the alternate route. Can’t go wrong with that.",0,
"I’ve always relied on google maps, but with the last update, the app is basically useless. I’ll be stuck in traffic but the route will be showing as blue (clear, no traffic), or vice-versa with the route in yellow or red but I’m moving fine. It’s like it isn’t being updated in real time anymore. Most recently, I tried to use the app to drive home from Philadelphia and the app could not figure out my whereabouts and kept telling me to turn the wrong way onto one way streets, saying “turn left” when the route was showing turn right, and re-routing me even when I was still (supposedly) on the same path. It also won’t re-route me if there’s traffic anymore. There was a slowdown and I had to completely close and kill the app and reopen it to find a better route on my own. Not convenient, and dangerous when driving! I’m probably going to be switching to a different gps app, because this one just isn’t reliable anymore.",0,
"till i made a private list for my business, then the list formatting changed from text quick reference to pictures listing which is much more time consuming to scroll for next location till memorized routes. Second is how inaccurate routes are put forth, example is what roads are given preference for travel compared to either directness or quickness and real time up to date like construction of bridges underway google maps tells me to follow where road used to go and not current update in last year. The updates have not been to real time as much as claimed so I have been using alternative directions, this morning was the worst so I didn’t use the maps at all. Google your products are not working like they used to so maybe you can fix what you broke, I used your service for accuracy in serving others and at this rate I will just keep a paper map in car when needed as I service more than one area.",0,

"This is the best, most useful app I have. My favorite features are the blue dot, the thing that indicates which direction you’re facing, and the traffic info with real time re-routing. Younger folks may not realize how much of a leap these represent over paper maps. I also love how you can view multiple route choices and see the time and distance differentials. You can view your progress on this map or opt for turn-by-turn directions. I use both options, depending on the circumstances. This gives Google Maps the edge over Waze IMO. With Maps, I feel in control, whereas with Waze I feel like I’m blindly following. Another favorite feature is the ETA. It is remarkably accurate and takes traffic into account. I no longer stress over traffic making me late.",0,
"I use google maps a lot, anywhere new I go I pull it up. I can’t say there aren’t glitches sometimes but I have not came across anything huge. However, I’m upset about the ability for me to label places such as “home” and “work”. My last iPhone had these labeled just fine, therefore if I was driving I could just type in “home” rather than my entire address which is much more time with my eyes on the phone. But as soon as I upgraded my IPhone, the labels were no longer there and the button doesn’t seem to do anything when I click it. And there isn’t even one now for my place of work. With me just changing iPhones I didn’t think it would be that big of a deal but it really takes a lot of time off the road to type in my entire address and that’s dangerous. But I do enjoy using the app when needed and it gets me from point A to point B",0,
Just like Google and Nest after Google bought Nest it is getting tough to decide which way to interact with these services. Google Maps is very robust but I prefer the way that Waze does navigation. While Google Maps benefits from the Waze data it does not seem that the reverse can be said about Waze. Yet Waze still seems to do navigation better. Google needs to get on with merging Google Maps and Waze into one product and give us the best of both. They’re both 5 star apps but when it comes to navigation Waze is just 0.001 stars better. Google Maps is so much more than navigation which is why I have both downloaded on my phone but Google Maps would be the ultimate maps app if they just merged Waze into it.,0,
I’m a big of the Google maps app. I’ve used it for years on the iPhone 6s Plus. Unfortunately for the last year or so. Google maps has been using an astonishing amount of data. 3-4 megabytes per minute. I’ve downloaded all the local maps via WiFi but still the app eats data. Most of the time I go to Settings/cellular and turn off cellular data for Google maps. It still works with gps but that leaves me without traffic updates and the maps are blurry. I just upgraded to an iPhone 11 and put in a new Verizon sim card but the high data use remains unchanged. I can easily see the data use by resetting data statistics and turning on and off cell data for the app. I can’t find anyone with a similar problem online and the Verizon guy hadn’t heard of this issue before. Any help out there?,0,
"If you use this app for traffic DO NOT UPDATE.  Traffic previously was on by default, that is no longer the case, and there is no way to change it.  Every time you want to check the traffic, you have to go into the layers and now turn traffic back on.  Close the app, and then come back in, guess what, traffic is gone again!  After about the 3rd time of, ""why is there traffic, my app said there was no traffic?!""  Oh... pos turned turned traffic off with the update.  Rip.  App is usually 5 stars.  Latest update made it infuriating.  Fix traffic on by default, or let us manually turn traffic on and leave it on, and you'll go back to 5 stars. Thanks for the reply.  Back to 5 stars.",1,"Thank you for letting us know about this issue, and your patience as we fixed the problem. We appreciate it! With the latest update, Google Maps should now be working as usual."
"It’s a good app but has several bugs that make it really frustrating at times. As mentioned previously, the app freezes sometimes. Other times, the voice navigation stops completely and you have to look at the app to see where you have to go which can be dangerous while driving. Sometimes the displayed map gets completely flipped and there’s no way to align it with the way you’re actually driving without taking the map “off center”. My final issue which is the MOST FRUSTRATING is that the app continuously makes mistakes in location in regards to whether you’re on a highway or not. It constantly thinks I’m a street over and missed the entrance, which leads it to make several contradictory, confusing statements in a short span of time. This alone has caused me problems so many times since I’ve moved to a new city that I’m giving up using the app.",0,
"This app has come a long way, but I find the ETA calculation to be frustrating because it appears to be based on the fastest vehicles in current traffic.  So unless i am the absolute fastest car I am always seeing the ETA creep later and later.  If I go the speed limit on a 10 hour trip i lose about 2 hours over the course of trip. (Yes I am accounting for the amount of time we are at rest stops.) Please allow options for estimates based on the speed limit, perhaps with the ability give it a plus or minus fudge factor based on the user’s driving habits.  Also the ability to set a max speed for those of us that haul trailers and never exceed a certain speed would be wonderful.  For example I never exceed 60mph when towing my camper, but in lower speed areas follow the speed limit.  Thanks for listening.",0,
"I had originally given this a 5-star review, but the app appears to still have way too many glitches that it’s been a frustrating experience trying to use it for directions. I originally really enjoyed this app, so much so that I deleted the default apple maps app, but I have now deleted google maps, as there appears to be a lot of bugs since the last update. The app constantly thinks I’m on the street when I’m on the freeway which throws my directions all off. Additionally, the app appears to freeze in one location pretty regularly, and I have to close the app and restart it to get it to track my location accurately again, as it freezes with the last directions showing, and I’m literally driving blind at that point till I notice that it has frozen again. I was a big fan of the app before, but it’s a little too frustrating for me to use at this point. as it does not appear to be as reliable as it was before.",0,
"It used to be very simple to use.  You click on the directions button and it would automatically take me to the app and pull up the direction options, all with one tap.  Now, ever since two updates ago it takes many more steps.  I tap directions and it takes me to directions on the website, that’s if it loads which it doesn’t always, then it asks if I would rather use the app, click yes and it says it will save the address for me.  However for unknown reasons it doesn’t go right to the app I have installed, it has to go through the App Store.  Then I have to click on open in the App Store.  Finally I’m in the app, but I still need to tap destination and hope the address is saved, isn’t always, and “add” the address for my destination.  You made something that was very easy to use into something that now takes multiple steps where things can go wrong.  Go back to the way it used to be.",0,
"I’ve never written a review for an app before, yet here I am sitting in the parking lot of my destination because it’s so annoying that google maps keeps telling me to “turn left after McDonalds” or “continue straight past Chase Bank.” I can’t stand it. I hate being verbally advertised to while I’m driving — it’s distracting and ineffective and it also makes navigating more difficult. It also makes the instructions take 3 times as long to be communicated to you. I literally hate the interface and functionality and all the dumb icons and stickers of waze, but I guess that’s what I’m using now. Oh and, it’s really annoying when it tells you to turn left without a signal onto a 6 lane street at rush hour when you could have just stayed on the big street you were already on and gotten through fine. And it can never figure out what direction I’m facing anymore so it’s always confused about what to tell me to do, making it pretty useless anyway.",0,
"I have always used google map as my main navigation system. I love the satellite view which helps looking for places and navigating to places super easy. The simplicity of the design and overall app is just what I need. However, apps like Waze, (which I think is operated by Google. Idk) is adding updates and changing how we should use a map. You can add all types of indicators such as traffic, or accidents and even where Police officers are. It’s very user friendly and community friendly. It’s all about helping each other around you get places faster and safer. I feel like if Google Maps can implement where we can tag police officers locations or just so we can tag and indicate anything on the map, it would be the perfect map. But overall it’s still my go to navigation app. 👌🏼",0,
"Let me start by saying I'm a Google fan. I always been using Google maps and it was always working great. It used to announce the turns multiple times like in 2 miles, 0.5 miles take exit X and so on. But now since past one month it stopped announcing intermittently and also the banner on the top which shows directions is also not getting updated to the correct turns. I have no problem with any other apps with either internet or even my phone. I got iPhone 11 pro. And the internet is also on 4G LTE. My app is upto date. I usually don’t write reviews but looking at the app I love being buggy is making me feel bad. I can share any logs or information that would help you guys figure out what’s wrong. Please don’t respond generic saying update app or check any settings. It’s clearly the app.",0,
"I never write reviews but in this case I had to. I use to always use the Maps app until recently I’ve noticed that certain places will not open up in the Maps app and they prompt you to download the Google Maps so I did. At first it was great. Worked just like the regular maps I had on my phone already, but now for the past several weeks whenever I Google a location that I want to go to and I tap on the address to be navigated there it opens up the map and I choose use current location as my starting point. it will then open the map and have me sitting there in the middle of nowhere with the little blue radius just sitting there pulsating and it will not direct me turn right turn left go to this street go to that street it does not give any directions now what so ever on where to go. it will always show me how to get there on the overview and how long it will take me to get there but that’s it it won’t give me any directions so it’s worth less now.",0,
"The thing that annoys me the most is when Google starts talking to me rather than just navigating.  “This route avoids a closure..” I do not care just take me where I need to go.  “This route avoids traffic..” stop giving me information that’s not going to help me get to my destination.  I’m not asking for a news report, I just want to get somewhere.   I don’t want to hear about where you could have taken me, just where I need to be.  I can’t mute it because I tend to not pay attention to my phone while I’m driving, and forget the directions are there. There are some glitches I’m not sure if they’re my phone or google maps but sometimes as I’m driving forward, maps will rotate or act like I’m turning but I’m not. It will spin and change the navigation and won’t correct itself for another mile or so. Update in response to developer: You didn’t read my review, I would like to turn on voice navigation ONLY.  I want to turn off traffic and road closure alerts when navigation begins. “This route avoids a closure on ..... “ does not help me.  I don’t need or want this information I just want to get to where I need to go.  I don’t need to hear about roads I’m not taking.  As for the bugs I’ll show you what I mean on Twitter where I can upload screen recordings.",1,"""Thank you for your review.

"I've been a long term user with Google Maps and it's always incredibly accurate with traffic conditions and travel times. It is excellent in providing lane information and getting you efficiently from point A to point B. I do have one issue that is rather significant enough to lower my review from a perfect 5 stars to a 4 star rating. The app will try and direct you in the wrong direction down one way streets. Be very cautious when you are making turns that the direction the app is directing you in is a valid and legal turn. In conclusion, this is not a completely major issue so long you follow the rules of the road in addition to the app's instruction. This app is a fantastic app at getting you where you need to be. By far, I would recommend this app well beyond the other navigational apps out there.",0,
"I use this app daily. I use it to quickly find info on businesses or restaurants in my area as well as other areas. From there I can see the phone #, hours of operation, pics, reviews, busy times or not...in real time! Many other functions I can’t recall off the top of my head. But...I usually go to Waze for my drive. I don’t know why, I just like it better with real-time traffic and accidents, also police and red light camera warnings. I do sometimes use this app for my drive if I feel Waze isn’t taking me the right way but honestly I have more errors of destination with Google. Perhaps it’s because on Waze you can contribute to the routs and shortcuts. They seem to study the routes one takes and I believe their updates are done quickly. But I still love this app for info.",0,
"I’ve always used Google Maps over Apple Maps but I’ve had several ongoing issues for the past few months. The sound has stopped working properly and I don’t think the app is announcing all the directions it should be even though I have to set to announce all directions. The app frequently thinks I’m in a different street or facing in the opposite direction or doesn’t follow along when I turn. Just two days ago I ran into a road block due to a parade and had to turn off my route but the app never recalculated directions. After 5 minutes of driving I ended up having to close the app and restart it, which isn’t exactly the safest when driving in busy city traffic. I have kept up with all app and phone updates and have a very reliable phone carrier so I don’t think this should be happening.",0,
"I use this app every day for basically everything due to time management. I think the “leave on time” feature can use a little bit of an adjustment. Lately, I’ve been leaving 20 minutes SOONER than mentioned and still arriving 40 minutes late due to unexpected rush-hours. ***One other feature that would SUPER FREAKING FANTASTIC would be the ability to take the scenic route somewhere. I road-trip a lot and sometimes I’d rather just be able to go check out a byway along the route that’s scenic than be forced to stay on the highway for the “fastest route”. *** Something else that could be a potential feature would be to avoid high-crime areas. One route the app typically wants to take me down has a strong history for being not the greatest neighborhood (think Amanda Berry release story potential). Fair warning would be super helpful in these parts of town (potentially with a feature to turn it off if someone is okay with it)? Regardless, like I said, I borderline abuse this app. I’ve been using it almost to the annoyance of my boyfriend because I keep finding new places to go with him. Will always keep using as opposed to the built in feature in the phone itself for ios.",0,
"I recently moved from iPhone 7 to iPhone X’s. Most things seem to work well however Google maps has a major problem. I am not able to use the timeline future, and feel that it is because I cannot remove devices that I do not own or use. I have one iPad, and one iPhone, and yet google reports that I have two of each. When I go to settings to remove these devices there are no remove buttons so I’m stuck with them. Being frustrated in the effort to remove devices, I tried to change my password. I was sent to a screen that had scrambled letters which I had to enter in order to be able to change the password. I gave up after more than 20 tries of trying to read those letters and enter them correctly. So, I can’t even change my password. Is there any help available in this kind of situation? Thanks.",0,
"Unbelievable. This is a pet friendly motel. We arrived and settled in for the night with our 13 year old kitty. We were in the room maybe 45 minutes tops when we couldn’t find our cat. Flabbergasted, we looked everywhere in the room. I then saw a big hole in the wall under the bathroom sink. We were positive that’s where he went. But where? Did he fall into a basement and was he okay? My boyfriend called the front desk in despair and asked for help. The very inexperienced front desk clerk said he did not know of any hole and would be right down. After fifteen minutes of waiting, my boyfriend started walking to the motel office where he met the desk clerk. Apparently the clerk was intimidated by my boyfriend ‘s looks. The clerk called the police and demanded us to vacate the premises WITHOUT OUR CAT. I refused. The cop was on our side but had to obey the property owner. My boyfriend and the cop found a way into the subfloor of the motel and found my kitty alive and well. We still had to leave with no refund. I have never been kicked out of a motel. I am 62 years old and am so appalled at this motels customer service We have received a refund but it is not enough compensation. We had to drive another two hours to find a pet friendly motel. We ended up at a motel 6 in Columbia, SC   If this motel chain can do no better than blame their local management for bad service, I recommend no one stay at a motel 6 unless you’re desperate",0,
"I normally don’t post reviews, and I’m not really breaking from that now. Lol, I do use google maps when my 7 inch gps can’t locate something, google maps has NEVER failed to locate it. I write this review to ask, “ you people writing reviews cry much?” I mean ,for real ,someone wrote that the app was steering him into police traps, really? I mean really? Police traps!! What exactly is a police trap anyways? Stop doing stuff the cops don’t like and there will be no traps that can catch you. LOL, As for the rest I would just say, if your too cheap to buy a gps and you still need a way to navigate you really can’t go wrong with google maps. I’m a truck driver and I search for a lot of addresses. I’ve decided if google maps can’t find it , then it simply doesn’t exist!",0,
"This app is great overall.   I love how it redirects me if there is traffic or an accident.   The one issue I have is as follows.  There is one road I travel, and it tells me to go 3 miles and then make a left.  Technically, the road dead ends in 1.2 miles and then you can only make a right turn onto a different road. After traveling 1.8 miles, I indeed do turn left onto the road I was told to turn on.  But because it doesn’t tell me to turn right, is this other roads that I will not be able to navigate correctly?  It seems like I am nitpicking, but if I use Waze, it tells me to travel 1.2 miles and turn right.  While we are on the subject of Waze, why can’t Google add the feature from Waze that lets me specify a number of mph above the limit before it sounds an alarm.",0,

"In 2019 when Google refreshed the map data it listed my address in the incorrect town. It is only two streets in my neighborhood that was messed up. All other streets are okay. This has caused HUGE problems for me. Deliveries cannot find my house because if you type in my address it doesn’t exist and will actually show a different location in my neighborhood as the place to go. I can’t get packages, I can’t get food deliveries, it’s just unacceptable. I have been trying for over six months to report this and get it resolved and there is absolutely no support!! I have reported via the web and the app to no avail. This is just ridiculous. I never had this problem before they refreshed all the map data. Literally only two streets in my neighborhood have the incorrect town. Is there no quality control prior to submitting data? There needs to be a way to report an error and get some sort of resolution.",0,
"I’ve loved getting my cars from Hubert Vester Toyoto for several years and I only deal with one salesperson. I’ve always had good service in the past from the service technicians too. However, my last three visits have turned me off! The staff was rude and judgmental. Today I went for a free oil change on my brand new Camry. I simply asked were they very busy and approximately how long it would take. I had worked that night and was willing to wait but not if it was very long. Miss smarty pants asked (and not very nicely) “Did you make an appointment?” Duh, if I had any appointment I would have said so. She said it would be about an hour and a half. So I said I would wait. I wait, and waited and waited some more. People came after me and left (no they all didn’t have appointment; how do I know? Cause they talk loud enough that everyone can heard..smh). Anyway, I’m aware that you take a chance when you just “show up” for service but that’s no excuse to display poor customer service. If she had said it was gonna be a very long time I would have come back or make an appointment for another day. I’ve taken my cars to Toyoto in Wilson so many times and spend so much money when I could have went somewhere else. New customer service staff... new attitudes. Well, no thank!",0,
"It doesn’t know where I am, tells me to turn on streets that I’m not near, spontaneously changes exits I’m supposed to get off on right when I’m up to them or after I’ve passed them, I needed to go to a DMV in another city and it took me all the way through some random residential neighborhoods only to find out going home it was a half mile down the street from the freeway exit, and the latest gem is when I entered an address from my current location that I’ve been to before, and it started directing me not to that address but to another address in my frequent list. I exited and restarted the route 3 times and it would not correct. I had to do a lot of local traveling this past week and I thought I would rip my hair out.

"Whenever I zoom in on a location, the map will jump, or skip to a different area near where I am attempting to zoom in. This has been going on for over a year-and-a-half for me, and at least 2 other people I know have this issue. (One owns a Galaxy S10, and the other an iPhone. I own an iPhone 11.) This is especially an issue when I am viewing an unfamiliar area on the map. I have done everything I could think of, from getting a new SIM card, to resetting my phone, and nothing has worked. According to someone I spoke to about the issue, it may be a GPS issue. Not sure how else I can explain this. Basically, imagine having the map move to a different area at random moments when you are zooming in. Not sure what the cause is, or why such a stupid problem like this is even happening for in the first place. If I could use an alternative to Google Maps that has all of its features, without the zoom issue, I would.",0,
"I honestly wonder if anyone on the maps team actually uses this on a day to day basis.  They keep adding great features and keep making the basic usability worse and worse.  Searched for something?  Here let me forget that and get you info on this entire area of the map you tapped on when trying to zoom in to see your search results.    Or hiding all ui when you miss tapping the ""here"" icon by 1mm, or refusing to allow you to tap anything on screen after you've already searched for something, or zooming to your current location on searches instead of searching in the area you zoomed to, or ignoring zoom out gestures during navigation until its zoom in animation is complete. Advice to the team: take a few sprints and go back to the basics.  Most of the abovehave been issues for years",0,
"For some unknown reason the “geniuses” at Google though it would be a good idea for the map to reorient itself to a fixed compass map every time the phone changes from portrait to landscape. This messes up the sense of direction that having an unfixed compass provides. Also It takes much longer to not only look at the phone and notice that the map is wrong, but I need to spend even MORE time to make sure to press the compass to bring it back to the unfixed perspective. Since I’m spending more time fighting this stupid app to stick with the perspective I want, it’s more time spent with my eyes off the road, likely leading me to get into a car crash and die. I sincerely hope Google will fix this issue or provide an option to permanently disable it. I notice that there’s an option for the app to always have a fixed compass map, it would be nice if when this option is disabled then the phone would always have an unfixed compass.",0,
"Hello Devs, I love your app and use it all the time. However, a couple years ago, you changed the voice mute button to include some alerts option.  I’ve never used this option.  I driver 30,000 miles a year and I’m constantly toggling between mute voice and not mute.  However, instead of just being able to tap on the screen once, like it used to be, now I need to tap on the screen and take my eyes off the road to then select the option to mute it.  Can you change it back so the mute voice button is very easy and effortless to access? Also, another big problem.  This started around September or October 2019.  Right when I upgraded to an iPhone 11 Pro.  Not sure if that’s a coincidence or not.  But the problem is that the app is sometimes sluggish to route me or change routes.  It used to be almost flawless before this.  And not it happens sometimes that the map just spins looking for the route.  Or if I decide to take a different street, it is slow to calculate my new route (by slow I mean like some seconds, but enough time to possibly miss the next turn or exit.  This used to not be a problem until recently.  Somehow it is slower now!) Anyways, keep up the good work guys!  I hope this review gets to you :) Thank you!!",1,"Thank you for letting us know about this issue, and your patience as we fixed the problem. We appreciate it!

"Though Apple's Maps might work more seamlessly with iPhone, Google Maps had listings that didn't even show on Apple's, and the reviews are more reasonalble. Whereas on Apple's Maps reviews (supposed to be based on Yelp) are rather low, as if no one can be satisfied and thereby giving inaccurate representation for quality of places. AND this one had the actual website for a place that happened to tell they wouldn't actually be getting together at that location on the particular day I was thinking about visiting, and that they would be elsewhere; whereas Apple Maps had the general website for the whole company instead of that specific location, which I wasn't sure was a thing.",0,

"This app is painfully close to being the best it can be. I really like that it displays satellite view on CarPlay. I like that it normally understands what I tell it. I don’t like that it doesn’t show the speed limits. Occasionally, it will when navigating to a specific location, but never when just driving. When navigating somewhere, it will tell you that you will be turning right in 10 miles, but it says you’ll stay in the road you’re on. I think it should be telling you what road you’re going to be turning on to. That way, you can read the exit signs and be in the correct lane as you approach the area. Instead, it only changes to tell you which road you’re turning in to maybe 1/4 to 1/3 mile before you get there. In congested traffic, that can be WAY to late to get to the correct lane. I’ve written app support several times, and have NEVER received a response. I thought “Support” meant that they would assist you. That’s just plain rude. I really don’t want to use a different app when traveling. I’m just afraid they’re going to force me to. I’m getting ready to go in a 3500+ mile trip to areas I’ve never been before.

"There are three main issues that I have with this app that make it not very good to use. 1:Lack of accuracy when it comes to what direction I’m going. At least half of the time when O start moving it shows me going in the wrong direction therefore has the directions going the wrong way. This is absolutely terrible when in an area you don’t know or are in a parking lot with no street names to reference. 2:This app consistently gets the end destination wrong. Whether it be that it ends me on the street behind my destination or in a large plaza saying I’ve arrived. Also, the directions don’t take into account other entrances to plazas and will have you drive way out of the way to the plazas main entrance when one could save a few minutes by not having to wait at a red light to turn in. 3:No speed limit indicator. Please bring this feature back. Apple Maps has it, come on Google. It is a very convenient feature! The directions and routes for the most part are good. However the UI is not the best nor are the directions displayed very intuitive nor informative sometimes. If Apple Maps had better execution I’d use them all day. However your app is NOT good. Since your directions are better and that’s what I need, you eek the competition by a hair...",0,

"While I see the value in only seeing one step at a time; I frequently find myself getting lost when I have to run into the city because I don't have the exits all memorized (or I wouldn't need GPS) and Google doesn't provide me with enough information to choose from multiple lanes. I can't count how many times it says take the left two lanes or displays just an exit, and then I find I needed to be in the left most ( not either of the left lanes) to catch my split when the road forks and I wind up going the wrong direction because it was too late to get over in moving traffic once Good decided to tell me I actually need to get over.

My biggest complaint is the fact it’ll reroute you WITHOUT ASKING YOU! Pay close attention! It does it. I’ve driven all over the country. I’ll set it for one route that I wanna take. It’ll start making changes without asking! My other big complaint. When you go to try to look for what exit number you’ll be taking down the road.... it won’t tell you up at the top of the screen like it use too. HEY GOOGLE! MAKE IT SO YOU CAN SEE THE EXIT YOULL BE TAKING 20 miles up ahead like you use to have it! GET RID OF THE LOOKING FOR A FAST ROUTE!",0,
"Google maps has been my preferred map app for years, but when I recently had to replace my old iPad, I was very disappointed to discover that searching for a location launches an inset window advertising restaurants, hotels, shops and points of interest near the location I searched for and blocking my view of fully half of the map. When I tried to map a route from point A to point B, the app again opened an inset window blocking half the map with a display of written directions.  In the past it was possible to minimize the former (much smaller) window, while retaining the location pin(s) and any route highlighting on the map, but now the only option appears to be to close the window completely, which erases this important information from the map. This huge inset feature and the inability to minimize it severely reduces the utility of the app for its primary purpose — mapping!",0,

Last week I made an appointment to have junk in my basement and garage picked up. Three young people arrived right on time. A sister and brother from the JDog veteran family and a young man just home from Army Reserves. They were extremely efficient and courteous. The sofa from the lower level was large with large roll arms; but they worked it around the corner and out without making a mark on the walls. The sister was monitoring and making sure of safe removal. The price was very fair and to my delight i received a note in the mail with a Salvation Army receipt for the donation of two chairs. I liked the fact that i could support a veterans business that helps other veterans. I will definitely use JDog for any future junk removal or hauling. Janet,0,
"I use this app daily for public transport information. Recently, they added a feature where you can check often what buses are running in your area without typing in a destination, which made it great. If I was mid travel &amp; wanted to potentially change plans, I could see all my options. With the newest update, I have immense difficulty to find information on any route. They are forcing the home/work options and its positively awful. The devs want you to type in these two destinations and its extremely heinous to switch out the mode (honestly, I haven’t figured out how to make it stop doing this). I was so much time trying to figure out how to use this app, and if in an emergency or rush, could be screwed so easily. This recent update has made me go from loving this to researching replacement apps. I have absolutely no need for the home/work function, and it prevents me from using the app entirely, as I then can’t easily search for other routes.",0,
"Dr Klein is the best Podiatrist I have ever met and I have met many. My only regret is that I didn't meet him sooner. Meeting him sooner would have saved me a lot of money, time and most importantly pain. I had been to many foot doctors over the years and was almost to the point of giving up and accepting that I would have foot pain for the rest of my life. Upon my first visit I was assured by Dr. Klein that he would get rid of my pain and he did. He is kind, considerate, extremely competent and did his best to explain everything to me. Within weeks, I am now pain free thanks to Dr. Klein. If you feel like you have tried everything and are still suffering, please don't give up and give Dr. Klein a chance to help you. You will not be sorry that you did.",0,
"I would give google maps 5 stars if I had the option to see a map with the overview of my route displayed on my phone screen when using CarPlay. As it is now, I get step by step map directions on my car screen (that’s good) and a list of sentence directions for my entire route on the phone screen. Not only do I not have time to read an overview like that while driving—I shouldn’t be! It’s unsafe. Seeing a map picture of the entire route would be much more helpful particularly when I’m using google maps for my commute and am fairly familiar with the various roads. I can see quickly if it’s having me deviate from the usual route further ahead to avoid a delay. At least having the option for a map overview instead of text would be nice.",0,
"I completely depend on this app as a provider of health care services to homes. I enter many addresses daily, and have enjoyed the recent addition of the timeline feature as a backup to my record keeping. One innovation in the most recent update that I dislike is that when the destination is entered, the graphic focuses immediately on the area closely surrounding the address. Previously, a small schematic of the whole route popped up first, before activating the start button. If most of the route was familiar, I could leave the app off until I needed it for final turns—much better than hearing directions from my own driveway to the entrance of my neighborhood, and on all the way to the destination. Please restore the whole-route schematic at the beginning!",0,
"This app has always been an indispensable tool for me. But with the addition of live traffic (in my city) and custom labels recently, it's become an invaluable navigation app. Thank you Google for this app. I generally don't rate and review applications, but I just had to give the new Google Maps the 5 stars it so rightly deserves. UPDATE: Took away one star because navigation, location-sharing, and review-writing don’t work in my country. Another star because directions stopped working, too! I hope it’s just a bug and not another one of Google’s arbitrary policies of disabling features for certain countries. Come on Google. DON’T BE EVIL! BTW, Apple Maps is much more accurate and  detailed than Google Maps now. If Google decides to disable its one saving grace, i.e. directions, altogether, I might as well use the superior Apple Maps.",0,
"For people that need a good navigator, Apple maps is far better than Google maps in almost every way. Google maps has priorities that will waste a lot of people’s time. It decides to load information about the road first, rather than loading information of the road itself. i.e. traffic instead of the actual route. because of this, it takes quite a while to load routes and reroutes, and by the time one is found, you’ve missed a turn and the process starts again. it basically forces you to stop and find one ahead of time. Another problem is the fact that it doesn’t tell you the speed limit of the road that you are currently on. BUT THE BIGGEST PROBLEM! a problem so big it basically renders googles map USELESS!! Is that it calculates your routes based on distance, and not the speed of the roads. example: there are two routes you can take to your destination; a beltway and a b-line road straight to it. the beltway route is about 5 miles, but is posted at 70 mph and will take you no more than 7 minutes to get there. The b-line road however, is only 2 miles, but posted as 10 mph. guess which one it will choose? This is pretty much exactly what happened to me. Google maps turned, what could’ve have been a 10 minutes trip, to a full 40 minute one. This is just unacceptable. How it is at the moment, Google Maps is pretty bad.",0,
"GUYS, urgent!!! DEV TEAM!!! Why can’t we see a real time traffic situation, once you open the app???? It is sooo inconvenient now, i open the app, and i don't see anything regarding real time traffic for that given moment when i launch the app. It is crucial for everyday drivers to see big picture of traffic in any city. I drive everyday in NYC, i used to open Google maps to see what the traffic is like, yes it was adjusted to it from the beginning once you download the app, but you could go to settings and simply turn that feature on. Now you can’t do it. I went from a to z in this new update, and nothing. Put that feature back in the app, pls!!! Giving 1 star , until its back. It is useless app now.",0,
"With the latest update, the Route Options buttons have stopped working. Tried reinstalling the app twice. ----------------------------------------------- Since the latest update, there is a problem. When using the directions screen, the displayed directions do not update. The next direction does not show the distance reducing as I approach it, nor does it disappear after passing it. If I go to the main map screen and then back to the directions screen, the directions are updated, but once again, they are frozen when I stay on that screen. The voice directions and the main map screen work normally. I tried deleting and reinstalling the app, to no avail.",1,"Thank you for letting us know about this issue, and your patience as we fixed the problem. We appreciate it! Google Maps should now be working as usual."
"wish it was possible for it to consider weather/road conditions more rather than just choosing what would be fastest in clear conditions. from northern michigan in the thick of winter &amp; with the polar vortex, most back/dirt roads are covered in ice, unplowed, edges not visible through the snow, slippery, etc. (basically: dangerous!) i wish there was a “take main roads” option or at least a way to override the time priority in favor of a more-traveled route that might add a few more minutes to the drive. “prefer paved roads”, maybe? i love google maps and its functions in warmer weather, but it did nearly kill me while trying to navigate me through an unfamiliar area to get to class last week soooo... eh...",0,
"Google- you know usability. You can do better. I want it to to be easy to find say a pet store along the route that I’m following a google map. If I pick up my phone to look for a store your app either shows me home places or places Right where I am. I want efficient routes. Places that are closest all along my route. I want to add them with one click. I want google to make suggestions for efficiency on the order of the stops (and I want to be able to change them).  Then when I stop at the first place and turn off me engine thereby decoupling my phone from my car, I want you to both remember my plan and have communicated it to my car. It’s not at all easy to enter multi stop maps. And the frustration way outweighs the benefit. Then, when you disconnect from your car on a long trip to say get coffee, Directions all vanish. It’s an opening in the market. You are fast. Please fix it.",0,
"I’ve been using Google Maps since as long as I remember. Since I’ve moved to a certain part of Brooklyn this app has been the absolute worst. I always have to uninstall then install it again, it never knows my location, and more often than not the results I get for a trip are “can’t find a way there.” I keep this app updated, my location services are always on for this app and I have great cell phone service in my area. I have no issues with other apps that require location services, such as Uber and Lyft. Not sure what’s going on with this app. I thought it was a glitch or something, but the issues above are recurring and have been since for the last several months. The app works great when I’m not a planning at trip from my house to anywhere else via public transportation.",0,
Google maps used to be more accurate. There was an update recently that has changed the way the app is reading my location. It’s not as precise and often does not zoom in closer to my location when I am in neighborhoods or areas with lots of streets. It has made navigating these areas a bit stressful because I have to slow down and wait for google maps to catch up with me. It also seems to change its mind about my position on the street when I’m stopped at a stop sign or in a parking lot (or even just parked on the street.) It will show my position correctly for a moment and then decide I’m facing 90° to the right and recalculate my directions based on that. Then when I start moving again it has to recalculate again. I don’t trust Google maps anymore and will probably start using my iPhone Maps app instead.,0,
"Under normal circumstances, this app is usually accurate about predicting my arrival time right down to the minute. At the moment however, I am stuck in a traffic jam that it told me about beforehand but assured me I was on the fastest route. I am currently sitting at a standstill about 2 miles from my destination which it said I would reach over an hour ago. It obviously is not taking into consideration the flow of traffic in real time. Disappointing. Next time there is a traffic jam, I will use Apple maps instead. PS— it just now spoke for the first time in over an hour to tell me “You are in a five minute slowdown.” I don’t have to be a computer to see for myself that that’s a lie. I’m now over an hour and a half late to watch the presidential debates with my friends. I’m going to miss them altogether, obviously. #SoftwareFail #WTFGoogle #FixThisBug In the end, I was over two hours late. Missed the debates entirely. Oh, and: I can’t fix the sound on it. It will not talk to me except for emergency stuff. When I followed the directions about how to fix the volume, it just refreshes to the same thing that I don’t want to. I may have to trash this stupid app and reload it.",0,
"Edit:  THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU for bringing the default traffic layer back!!!! 5 stars again 🙌🏼  I love you.  Seriously. *************** I've been a loyal Google Maps user for years.  It's the best map for traffic out there, until recently.  With whatever update, you guys removed the default to traffic option.  We now have to toggle traffic on each time we open the app 😖 Since I'd think most people use your app FOR ACTUAL TRAFFIC when commuting or directions...this change is a huge misstep. It's one thing to take it away, then have an option to turn it on in settings...but that's not even there.  Please change it back or give us an option.  Thank you!",0,
"Update: After my poor review comprising about the traffic toggling off all the time, the developers fixed this feature and replied to my review. Google maps is better again, and I appreciate the quick developer response. I use the app every day to plan my commute and am happy that it works great again! Original Review: I agree with other reviewers. It used to be that once turned on, traffic showed up every time you started the app. Now you have to turn it on each time. Very frustrating! I may switch to a different map app if this is not fixed soon. I rely on the traffic maps to plan my commute, and toggling traffic on is difficult in the car.",1,"Thank you for letting us know about this issue, and your patience as we fixed the problem.

"We were selling our 1912 farm home and needed to replace the windows in order to get a sale.  D&amp;W gave us the lowest of the 3 bids, but also we felt it is a great quality window.  The installation people showed up at 10am and had replaced 11 windows, and cleaned up and they were gone by 4:30pm.  Shortly after, we sold our home.  We would definitely recommend them again. My husband is a contractor, but his specialty is not in windows and after coming home after a long week of work, he was relieved to have the project completed with out him having to do the work.  We only wish we would have had D&amp;W come and do that project a few years earlier so we could enjoy the windows, too.",0,
This app is a very impressive app it has the 3D walk were you can walk on a road and find out what’s around you. you can also can use google maps to find stores homes and businesses. You can also use the directional gps. I really love the app because it is a great way to learn everything around you. Now there is only one way to make it even better that is if you can get to walk in a building because I like to see what is inside of a building. That would be really fun and very interesting for other people to experience what’s inside big buildings. This is a great app I love it and I never have problems with it it loads instantly and it is ten times better than maps on an iPhone.,0,
"I travel a lot. 32 weeks out of the year, to be exact. And I have been trusting Google Maps to get me around each new city and small town I encounter... But with each update to the app, it seems to get less reliable. I had been holding off on the last 3 or 4 updates when my iPhone 6 finally stopped working for good yesterday, so I upgraded to an iPhone 8. Well, the newest version of Google Maps was installed, and today is my first try of real world use. Disappointed to report that while driving on an interstate the app thought I was driving on the outer road 3 times during the trip. Just out of nowhere, going down a straight interstate the app suddenly tells me to make a left turn to get back on the highway. Not once, not twice, but THREE times. Glitchy? I need this to work. I’m giving up just as much personal information to Google just like everyone else. The least you can do is keep your app reliable. Why “fix” something that wasn’t broken in the first place? Also, I don’t know who is working on your UI, but you just need to stop. Just stop what you’re doing and go do something else. Go to the park. Adopt a puppy. Do ANY THING ELSE but continue to screw up the UI that worked completely fine (and was more efficient) in previous versions of this app.",0,
"I recently upgraded your app and lost 4 or more years of data that I used to do time cards or just look back at where I’ve been even though I had my app preferences set to while using app , it was working fine for me like that , now it seems you , google maps are punishing me for not letting you SPY on my whereabouts 24-7. I like your app actually love your app I don’t think I should be penalized for not letting you watch me 24-7 , it should be my choice not yours. Why do you need this info anyway? I don’t need you to suggest anything for me if I want to know something I google it , I you tube it I wiki it what are you people after? Give me back my data you took and my choice to let you watch me.",0,
"It works great for bicycling directions, which is great for me, as I don’t drive, but what disappoints me is that it doesn’t support Dark mode on iOS 13, while Apple maps does. But Apple maps doesn’t provide bicycling directions, which is another disappointment for me. I hope the developers will find a way to support dark mode. This is the only app that provides bicycling directions while as Apple maps along with Waze that don’t, so I’m afraid that I’ll have to strain my eyes when looking for a place during the night time, so I’ll just have to put the brightness all the way down and hope that it doesn’t go back up while navigating. It really annoys me that I have to do it that way, and I don’t want to walk away from this app. So please support dark mode real soon guys, then I’ll give it five stars!",0,
"I do get good general direction when I do the initial search. However, as I’m driving with the app running Google Maps gets confused and thinks I’m on the access roads and keeps verbally telling me to re-enter the highway even though I have never left the highway. Then it repeatedly tells me to take exits that are not the ones taking me to my destination. Then, each time, it recalculated another inappropriate exit. I have been misguided into taking the wrong way by this app in the past causing me to be late because of an extremely extended travel time. Since then I’ve learned to question what it’s telling me and I have to decide what to believe and what to just ignore. This morning was extraordinarily error filled. That’s not good when I have an important destination. I hope that this app gets its issues remedied.",0,
"A badly needed feature that mapquest used to have is to allow users to specify a point I want on my trip. I love that google maps brings up multiple routes, but it doesn’t always show all logical routes and some that are clearly out of the question. If I could add a point on the map that I want to go through, I could see another alternate route. My example is the Washington DC beltway. Living on the western side of the city I would like to see whether to take the north loop or the south loop when traveling to Route 50 in Maryland. The app never shows the south loop. I know it’s a little longer, but it’s a much easier ride if the traffic isn’t bad. Also, I still need to use Waze after checking google maps routes, because of the alerts feature in Waze.",0,
"The major problem with Google Maps on iPhone is that when the app finds a new route, whether due to traffic, or a shorter/faster route, it forces you to tap Dismiss within a few seconds, or it defaults to the new route. So if you’ve chosen from the available routes before starting directions, it will still force switch to why it believes is the “better” route. If you wish to keep your chosen route, you have to take your eyes off the road, hands off the wheel, open the phone, navigate to the app, then press the Dismiss button. Dangerous. If you’re on a motorcycle, impossible. Searching online, I see that this is an EXTREMELY common complaint. It seems clear and logical that the default should be to keep your existing route, with an option to Accept the new route. Hopefully Google will listen and change this.",0,
"I just got the iPhone X and the latest update from today made the map very nice from edge to edge but I can’t use the app switcher when it’s giving directions. If you’re not getting directions, you can still switch between different apps, but when directions are being displayed you can’t get out without swiping violently into the setting tab. Raise the edge of the display slightly and I’m sure things will be back to normal with this great app. I gave 5 stars because this is the best navigation program there is, I don’t like Apple Maps and I use Google Maps everyday. Make that small change to fix the issue with the iPhone X display and it will be amazing again.",0,
"I've been getting a ton of use out of this widget. Living in NYC, it's amazing to have bus arrival times available in real time without having to rely on the MTA or poke around inside the app. Just this past weekend, the widget picked up that a bus was 4 minutes away, when the MTA said it was 14 minutes away! My big suggestion to make this widget even better would be to have the ability 'pin' your most used transit options so it's not necessarily location based. For example, my closest subway station is 3 blocks away, so my phone doesn't list it as an option for me. If I had a subway countdown clock available in my widgets at all times, that would significantly improve my commute!",0,
"Had our dryer vents cleaned by this group. These are firemen who started this company to clean out dryer vents that could cause fires. Had a great experience from the start. Brett was very friendly and professional on the phone when I called. We set an appointment and then I got a text and email to confirm. I got another reminder text the day before. Phar was the tech that came out. He too was very friendly and professional. He cleaned out the vents on our roof and then vacuumed the dryer interior. Wow!  What a difference it made in drying our clothes! This is one of the few companies that cleans the roof vents.  I highly recommend them to get your vents cleaned out, improve the function of your dryer and prevent any possible fires.",0,
"I was on my way to enjoy my vacation when suddenly my engine blew on I-4 between Daytona Beach and Orlando. Needless to say, I had to have my vehicle towed all the way back to Jacksonville and quickly figure out what kind of transportation I could find before the following week. Coggin came to the rescue! I saw a flyer that I received in the mail from Capital One about being pre-approved for a vehicle and for some reason, I hadn’t thrown it away. I called the number and went to Coggin Chevrolet at the Avenues. When I got there, Andrew Dove assisted me and a few hours later, I was leaving the lot with my BMW 550i! Mr. Dove and the staff took care of me and made sure that I was satisfied in all aspects. It was a good sales experience that was stress free!",0,
"Google Maps is not only the informative, intelligent navigation app we love but also such an ingenious way of enhancing personal experiences throughout everyone’s lives. Reviews inform people of what to expect before they ever leave home. Google Maps incorporates this into everything around us with location-sharing: when you visit somewhere public, Maps asks you what you thought of the place. With kudos, levels and updates, Google Maps motivates everyone to contribute more and more. This is an amazing way to involve everyone, and gather the most helpful information; information from the people, for the people.  Google just gets better and better.",0,
"Overall I prefer Google maps, especially now that I can use it with carplay. However, some small changes would make it even better. I'd like to have a watch app that alerts me of upcoming turns, like Apple maps does. I would also like to know when an intersection where I'll be making a turn is a stoplight. Just some things to make it even more user friendly. Update: Still would really like to have the watch integration, that's something I do like about using apple maps. Using Google has been fine around where I live, but has had some problems on longer drives. Recently, Waze was able to save me 45 minutes by finding an alternate route around a wreck when Google insisted the fastest way was to wait it out in traffic. Not thrilled with this app lately.",1,"Speed limits in navigation should be available in your country! Thank you for your patience as we roll this feature out. To use this feature (once it’s available to you) in the latest version of Google Maps just start driving navigation. In some locations, the maximum speed limit appears as a black and white box. In other locations, the maximum speed limit may appear as a red and white circle. You can learn more about this feature in this Google Maps Help Center article: https://support.google.com/maps/answer/3273406"
Google maps has been my favorite app due to its list saving ability for locations. It makes it really easy to save and group different types of restaurants into lists. By far the best city exploration app that exists. For future updates i would absolutely love to see the implementation of a list search bar in the “my places” tab. It gets kind of tiresome scrolling through all of my lists and trying to find the right one to save a new place into. If i could search through my lists and instantly identify the right one it would drastically improve my user experience. Other than that I absolutely love this app and I will continue to use it for city exploration.,0,

"I’ve been driving for work for about 20 years now and remember when Gps navigation was new. I bought this brand new program called Microsoft streets and trips with a usb GPS receiver for my laptop. It was awesome! Showed my current speed, laptop screen was huge and easy to see and best of all, I could add multiple stops to create a route. Most of us could use this on a dedicated shopping day let alone for work. As much as I love Google maps as my navigation of choice, I really wish it would catch up with features that have been available for years elsewhere. If this is currently an option and I’m just dumb, then please make it dummy friendly and easier to use. Otherwise, great work!",0,
"I use Google Maps for most of our travels. We travel by pickup pulling a fifth wheel. I always compare Google to whatever is showing on our truck’s GPS and generally reroute to match Google Maps. However, today when I did that, Google Maps put us on an unpaved road going over a very steep and curvy mountain. What a white-knuckle ride!! Very scary. After arriving at our destination, we found out that even most locals avoid that road and in winter, it doesn’t even get plowed! Thank goodness it’s June. We also found out that if we had been pulled over by the police, we could have faced a $10,000 fine! There needs to be an option to avoid unpaved roads. This is not the first time we wound up on unpaved roads during our travels.",0,

When I am bored, I just view random neighborhoods and places in other countries!! I even view my old houses I have lived in!! I just search up my recent address that I just moved away from, and boom!! There is my trampoline and car!! My mom uses it to navigate our new town and country, I use is for entertainment.

I rely on Google Maps whenever I get in the car to go someplace. It is save me so much time avoiding traffic congestion I cannot even calculate how much. Only one glitch I encountered I had put in multiple stops and I decided not to stop at the first stop and kept driving to the second stop but the map turned me around and brought me back to the first stop. I was going down the highway and all the sudden it just told me to take a turn I reacted in an hour later I arrived at my first stop. It would be nice if they could add a warning that you missed your first stop or a stop with a large enough button to click to override that. 5 1/2 years it’s always got me there on time.,0,
"Google maps has consistently failed to work properly in a variety of places, from New York City to Berlin. Typically, when someone writes a one star review, they tend to exaggerate problematic aspects of the app to suit a narrative. However, here, no exaggeration is needed. When driving in New York, google maps is unable to distinguish between driving on overpasses vs the streets underneath. If I’m going 40+mph, would I be going in the local streets with stop signs? What happened to all the machine learning? Wouldn’t you be able to distinguish, with the vast amount of data that you have collected, the difference between someone driving in a local vs high speed overpass? In Berlin, the app has consistently failed to map out correctly where to take public transportation. It creates fantasy routes, going through buildings and towers, impossible to follow and to use. So, this brings me to the question: who is working on this? What are these “engineers” doing? Engineers: if your natural inclination is to “solve problems”, know that you have solved few and created many. Congratulations on being able to do minimal spanning trees or topological sorts, but know that in reality this is utterly useless. Your computer science knowledge is applicable in a vacuum, useless, and creates more problems and no solutions, and you should be deeply ashamed.",0,
"Google maps have carried me around southeast Texas and parts of California for years.  I do not leave my house without checking Houston traffic conditions using Google maps. Thank goodness for this work they do!  I find the clarity of the directions priceless.  Occasionally the voice is behind on calling turns in a timely manner but 95% of the time the direction is given in time to get into the right lanes.  I wouldn’t mind a new setting that says “Avoid Highways” just so occasional I can take a road less traveled.  Also, there has been years of construction on the freeway near my home.  Poor Google voice used to get the ‘hiccups’ when I traveled it.  She still loses placement sometimes but those events are understood given the construction.  Use it!!!",0,
"The new feature lacks customizability. Can’t set different times for each day you go to work. Can’t have different locations you commute to regularly. Like, I go to school 5 days a week but then I go to work 3 of those days (and at different times each of those days). The feature doesn’t allow me to use school as my commuting destination without setting school as my work location. With the previous version, you could easily look at the most common places you drive to, tap on the one you want to drive to, and go. Now, you can’t. I like the idea of the commute feature to automatically set your destination at set times throughout the week, but it’s far from useful for someone like me who goes to different places at different times regularly throughout the week. Other than that, the app is great 👍🏼",0,
"So I updated the app this morning and actually needed it this afternoon. I mapped the route fine from my starting point, but as I drove, it started drifting way off. I put me about a mile to the north of the actual route. I had full LTE and was out in the open. I’ve used google maps along this similar routing before and never had an issue. Used to work just fine. I just don’t get why developers have to make tweaks to an already working, functional app and then break something that was actually useful. I tried closing the app and opening it again, but it still showed me way off. So, I opened Waze, and it worked beautifully. Just like a GPS map app should. Google Maps used to be my go to for directions, but not anymore. At least not this version. I did notice that the update had a more cartoonish look to the map and the UI. Dumb. I’d attach a screenshot or two, but the review won’t let me.",0,
"I’ve religiously used Google Maps (and still do) for so many years now. I love so much about it, especially the timeline feature, up until recently. I’m not quite sure what has happened but it seems as though Maps gets my timeline correct about 20 percent of the time now. It has me going to places I’ve never been and once it has me at a random house like two blocks away for 24 hours. I’ve tried everything besides deleting and redownloading so that’s what I’m doing now. I really hope this gets fixed soon. I’m not sure if it’s the app itself or IOS but either way I hope that it improves as this the beat navigation app in my opinion. The only other qualm I have is the ‘NESW’ directions. ‘Head North’ isn’t always the easiest thing to understand (or maybe I’m just dumb 🤷🏻‍♀️).",0,

"Over the last few months it has been shutting off randomly or freezing about 5 times per day. Deleting and re-downloading did not help, and my iOS is up to date. Also it doesn’t understand the right lane merges in the freeways in Columbus OH, and the voice doesn’t match the map so then you end up being in too early of a turn lane if you listen to the voice. The indicator that tells you which lane to be in also matches the voice and not the map and doesn’t take into account the many right lane merges directly before an exit that happens very frequently in Columbus OH. I have gotten lost every single time I have used the app driving on the freeways of Columbus near Worthington, Easton, and downtown during the last few months. It also doesn’t understand there has been construction near the highway leading to Easton and so the lanes are just completely incorrect.",0,
So the two lovely women at the front desk Eleanor and Rizia where amazing and such big helps in a situation that needed special attention which they were more than willing to accommodate. These two ladies are priceless and motel 6 should count their Lucky stars that they manage to keep ahold  of these two and be extra thankful they haven’t gotten headhunted by another establishment in need of bosses like these two. And trust me every other establishment need these two incredible women because just having them on staff will send their company stock through the roof. I will definitely stay at this motel 6 in Vacaville again no doubt. This is coming from a surprisingly thrilled to be satisfied customer.,0,
"Thanks for listening to complaints about Traffic option always defaulted to turned off. Reassuring to know that you actually try to fix these complaints. Good job. Also,  thank you very much for allowing us to delete search history more than one at a time. Yet, still not 100% 5 Star happy about how the Center-On button Automatically zooms in so much on your location. Especially after you got the map scaled to the size that you like to view traffic info and alternate routes, then refresh your location it automatically zooms in too much again, having to reset the desire map scale again and again.",0,
"I wish there was a setting mode where I could set Maps to drive only, I use the app a lot. Everyday multiple times a day and at times it switches over to walk mode which I have NEVER used, so that is an annoyance for me. I also detest the notification that pops up and verbally alerts me to my eta.  I don't need to hear what is clearly visible on the screen for me to read. Please give the option of a different voice?  A British one would be nice. How about this:  one that says the Latin names of streets with the right pronunciation? After the last iPhone update it has prompted me to use Apple maps which is problematic for me. How do I switch that off since I prefer Google maps?  Help",0,
"Minus 2 stars because the app forgets the original route when I'm going out of wifi area without data service, and GMaps attempts to reroute. This may change an originally toll-free route to a toll one - all without notice! Also, when out on the road and cellular data is off, and then I turn data on, the app takes at least 30 seconds before reconnecting/rerouting. This issue is very problematic when I'm Turing data briefly on to search for coffee/gas-stations along the route. Another issue is that the app consumes too much data - probably from downloading pictures associated with Point Of Interest's. My monthly data usage usually goes up to 70 MB's, and 100MB's for each roadtrips. It would be great if there's an option to reduce data usage for pictures.",0,
"The latest update has made the app not very friendly with the iPhoneX. When searching for directions it allows you to swipe to get back to the home screen or multitask to another app. However, when it is navigating this function is completely unusable. To get back to the home screen you have to swipe down from the top, move to another app, and then swipe up to go home. If it was designed that way to prevent using your phone while navigating then it was overthought and a bit too big brotherish. I certainly don’t need Google deciding how I should use my phone while driving. Also, I often use Maps as a passenger to help a driver navigate. I also use it frequently when walking in larger cities I travel to. I am hoping that this issue gets fixed soon so I don’t have to look for an alternative Maps program.",1,"2/28/18 Did this resolve your concerns? 12/14/17 Thank you for letting us know about this issue, and your patience as we fixed the problem. We appreciate it! With the latest update, Google Maps should now be working as usual."
"I don’t know what you guys did to the app but it is absolutely terrible! The last year, I can have the GPS going and not be moving. Google will freak out “turn left on Main Street, continue on north Main Street, turn left on Main Street, turn left on north Main Street” and it continuously does his until I either move or turn off the GPS! This has been happening on iPhone 6S, 7, 8, X, and my fiancé’s multiple androids! It’s obviously a problem on googles end. Today I missed an exit because of google and added 10 minutes to the drive. I knew I was getting close to my exit but put my faith into google that it would tell me. Wrong move. I unlocked my phone and it immediately says, “Turn on exit 100 in 450 feet”... while I’m three lanes over. Missed exit. The state of google maps is a joke compared to a few years ago. I have been against Apple maps since they came out but am reconsidering lately.",0,
"In my experience at the Holistic Dental Center, I found the atmosphere to be extremely professional and warm. The Dentest and nurses are fully knowledgeable in all areas of the latest and most effective holistic healing practices known to date. In a short time of following the easygoing instructions given, I surprisingly seen immediate corrective results. I wish I had known about this Dental Center years ago. I would recommend them to anyone that wants to start there corrective dental healing from the inside out. Food for thought, our smile is the first representative for our presence. So we should always become the best representative we can be. The Holistic Dental Center in my opinion is a no brained. Keep up the great work 👍🏽.",0,
"Big advantage over others is that you can set the volume level of voice-over within app settings independent of phone’s overall volume. If you’ve ever been on a long road trip, letting the the map run in the background while you listened to an audiobook, music, news or sports, then had the map interrupt at such a starkly diff volume it literally made everyone jump and cover their ears while you fumbled frantically for the volume, then you know how big a deal this is. Google map lets you adjust map VO relative to the other apps at low, med, or high with an in-app setting. Overall device volume still controlled the usual way.  THANK-YOU GOOGLE FOR FIELD TESTING!!!!!",0,
"1. The loading speed of this app while connected to Apple CarPlay is unbelievable. It takes 30+ seconds to switch between apps because of this app (it wasn’t a problem before when I was using Apple maps). It slows down all of the other apps in the background and caused some of them to shut down. 2. The map navigation kept talking while I was using the phone app to make a call through the car. The other person kept hearing my directions in their ear. 3. I was driving on the freeway through downtown LA when the app shut down on me. I was on a junction between three freeways when it suddenly closed itself and I had to guess which freeway to take. I’m lucky that I know the area, but if a tourist was using this app, they’d be lost and late. A detour in downtown can result in 20+ minutes of lost time. Also, the app kept trying to navigate me to a new location every time it shut it self down. When I reopen the app, it would take me to a different place than the most recent location. I love google maps for traveling on vacation or just whenever it’s not plugged into my car, but it’s just unusable for me when I drive, which is 95% of the time when I use the app. I really hope fixes are made because it’s a good app and I’d like to move back from Apple maps.",0,
"Google maps is great for the average person, who uses it to get around, look at reviews, etc. But, for a contributor, it can lack in certain areas. For example, there is no way to add a body of water. I live near a small river where people swim and fish in. But, I can’t add it to google, even though it deserves its own name. Also, there should be a way to add new roads or trails. There is a way to NAME already existing roads, but no way to mark new ones. There is also no feature to add trails either. It would also be useful to translate all of the place names into whatever language you use in the app. These are my suggestions to improve the app. The app is the best if it’s kind by far though, so keep up the good work!",0,
"I use an iPhone XS Max with iOS 12.3.1.  For the last year, Google Maps periodically has a glitch... It is delayed by a few seconds. I have two iPhones and this occurs on both, again periodically. I sometimes make a turn and it takes google maps 3-6 seconds to catch up and show I made the turn.  However, this a major problem because it also does not warn you to make a turn, since according to the app i am still 6 seconds from the turn, which is too late and I miss the turn. As I said, this glitch comes up periodically. I have been trying to determine what is the pattern when this occurs. I will keep trying to figure it out, but my guess is that it happens when charging the battery with wireless charging (I think this only occurs while in Prius Prime) and the battery is on the lower side, below 30%.",1,Thanks for your review!

"Would be a good app as it has all the bells and whistles, but oh my does it pick routes that are often longer in distance and more time consuming. I recently became a Lyft driver, clocking in 50 hours a week, relying on this app for navigation to pick up passengers all around San Diego. I'll give the app that it chooses a good route about 70% of the time, but also often chooses a route that makes me drive minutes out of the way to get back to the same street I was already on. When it comes to my local town, oh boy does it choose ridiculous routes! Especially in residential areas, it will make me go on a wild goose chase while I could have easily taken one street all the way to my destination with less miles and less time. Honestly, the iPhone navigation app was way better, but as a Lyft driver we have to use this or Waze(even worse).",0,
"Great maps app, navigation accuracy depends greatly on user input to correct the errors, but errors are generally easier to correct. I also use the reviews to find decent places whenever traveling to a new location. Google has made and continues to make improvements to the app, which shows how much they care. I just wish Apple could go back to the good old days when they were smart enough to just use google maps. We really don’t need twice the earth data out there. The battery dies if you leave the app running and navigation while driving greatly depends on your carrier. Verizon and ATT have proven superior in my experience.",0,
"Google Maps used to be my go-to navigation app. I’ve used Waze and Apple Maps, too, but I’ve stuck with Google Maps for many years, and for various reasons. Recently, Google Maps has been late updating my location while I’m driving/navigating. Yesterday, this caused me to get turned around two times and miss one off-ramp on the expressway in Jacksonville, FL. I do not like looking at my phone while driving, so I rely heavily on the voice announcements, which are not helpful if Google Maps shows me miles behind my actual location. A trip that should have taken me 30 minutes (into an area I was unfamiliar with), took me 45. I’ll have to stick with one of the other two navigation apps until this is fixed. Get lost is not good, especially when you’re in a sketchy area in downtown Jacksonville!",0,
"Since I’ve owned this app, over four years now, Alaska has always been in winter. It goes to show that even google doesn’t know anything about Alaska. I’m amazed that google can’t get this right. You should google it but google is wrong. Do you  know we are part of a rainforest, we have deserts and “every” other type of climate with “every” type of season in “every” part of the state. If you’re going to keep just one season, make it summer so it’s not in black and white without depth. Can’t tell you how much this angers me year after year after year. I’m in Canada now trying to get some landmarks to help show where we’re going. You fail. Big time. So you get no kudos from me till you change. I’d love a response, like, don’t you live in igloos? Cause that’s where I think you’re at with your geography, it’s like it’s from California teaching everyone it’s always winter in Alaska and that we’re located next to Hawaii.",0,
"So without any warnings or alerts, the developers decide it’s a good idea to invert the map on your directions. Instead of the Point of View being behind your car, it was flipped to being in front of your car. So all the turns (in my view) appeared to be backwards. I don’t understand how anyone could think this was a good idea. We’ve had GPS navigation since the early 2000s, and there was never a problem. So why would you change the formula? Please fire whoever decided it was a good idea to ‘fix’ something that wasn’t broken. I don’t care if it’s a setting I can change, I’m never using this app again. They forced users to experience their new, flawed navigation without warning them they will need to be seeing the directions backwards. I would give this a 0 star rating if that was an option. Come on Google you are better than this.",0,
"I have always been a google maps user. The last 3-4 months, this app has been driving me INSANE. Every time I use the app, I will be following the route, and without warning it reason, it shows that I have left the route. It shows that not only have an made some turn, or route change, but that I am going the opposite direction, or at times just floating around. It’s then takes up to 2-3 minutes to get back to the original route, that I never strayed from. It’s so frustrating. It has caused me to miss so many exits, turns, and important directions. It has made me late, because while it is freaking out about my change in route, I miss the exit or direction I needed, because I didn’t make any changes! It’s super frustrating and Waze isn’t any better later.",0,
"DEVELOPER RESPONSE IS WRONG. THIS WAS NEVER FIXED! THIS ISSUE IS SUPER IMPORTANT.  Like in the days of DOS the iOS app version only allows a maximum of 500 starred entries to be shown. Furthermore when starred places are not shown, they don’t even show up as unstarred - they get completely hidden on the map - doing the exact opposite of what starring is supposed to do!  If you want people to fully use Maps extensively especially in HUGE cities like NYC and for people who travel a lot and contribute much time and effort to be a local guide for Google, you MUST raise these severe limitations! Right now I can’t star new locations without the fear of other vital locations not showing up as starred in the app. As a google guide this makes me feel like my whole effort here is getting ruined. Other people have also commented about this online. This needs to be fixed. At least make it a setting that we can adjust as needed.",1,"Thank you for your patience as we worked on this problem.

"Google Maps has been THE standard ever since the beginning.  It has deserved that spot.  Everything about how it worked and the features it provided was on point. I find that recently, it has been much more difficult to use maps.  It’s starting to show confusing unwanted search results, I assume in a bid to monetize it a bit more.  Probably the most frustrating aspect seems to be slight, almost indistinguishable, changes to the gestures and manipulation which causes unwanted selection, zooming, and general difficult operation. If the time it takes me to get to the search results I need keeps increasing, I’ll have to start looking around at other options, though I don’t think I’ll find a much better overall experience.",0,
"Update:  the latest version appears to have fixed the issue.  If you are having turn by turn problems, try version 4.4.  Thank you google for resolving the issue. For some reason, the past two updates have caused the turn by turn directions to not update in real time. They just freeze on whatever step you are in when you access the app.  This issue has been posted several times in the google help forum and they haven’t responded on the several posts nor resolved it with updates.  It used to be an almost flawless app.  Now it’s almost unusable.",1,Are you still experiencing this issue on version 4.44 of Google Maps?
About the only complaint I have is that when your going through the interface between screens the app will freeze. It does this quite often lately but thankfully not when your on the road. As a trucker I save all of my stops in a folder. Now if only I could separate my stops by state and in alphabetical order. My folder is becoming harder to navigate through with 50+ stops and counting. I use this along with my Rand McNally obviously because I can't go everywhere Google Maps wants to take me due to height and weight restrictions. If Google ever wanted to make a trucker's version of maps they would surely dominate if not decimate the competition. I have a feeling there's politics at hand preventing this from happening.,0,
"I routinely use Google Maps when I am going somewhere new or someplace I haven’t been very often. This past week the app failed me miserably. I was a chaperon/driver on a week-long school trip and Google maps would NOT speak to me! This was absolutely frustrating in different town and a van full of students. I have the app set up to provide me with all updates, but despite frequently checking this feature, the app still refused to speak with me. I know I am not going crazy because another chaperone experienced the same problem on the trip.... it is not good to have two chaperones lost in a new city by the way! Additionally my husband has encounter this flaw a few times on his own phone. This major flaw needs to be fixed and it needs to be fixed NOW!",0,
"Love that the new update includes the speeding limits (which I’m going to ignore anyway EL OH EL). The only navigation app I use! 4 stars because even though this app isn’t going to give you allllll of the ways to get to a place, it definitely excludes great alternatives that are well traveled and aren’t in shady areas. Also, the voice prompt indicating a turn could be a little bit better (I always have to look down to make sure I’m turning at the right corner) but I give GMaps props because it has improved over the years. I wish there was a way for GMaps to provide alternate routes based upon data they’re receiving from drivers. Thanks Google. Don’t know where I’d be without you! LITERALLY!",0,
"I love Google’s My Maps feature, and even its rudimentary access within the Maps app. Spent a month planning for a trip, color coding everything and planning to use my custom map while traveling. Next thing I know, Google Maps updates itself days before the trip, and the map is totally inaccessible from the app. None of my icons appear, so I’m screwed once I get to my destination city. Even worse, Google Maps auto-updates even when you set your preferences for it NOT to do so. I could use third-party software to re-install the old version, but Google will just override my preferences and force the broken update back onto my phone. Thanks a lot. Unlike a regular developer, the company is so gigantic there’s no way to talk to anyone when something is wrong. You’re allowed to screw up an update, but to force me to download that update is messed up.",1,"We appreciate you letting us know about this issue, and we thank you for your patience as we worked on the problem.

"It seems to be getting more difficult to program simple driving directions. Lots of eye candy / useless features pop up when choosing routes. We use the app primarily for longer distance driving. It also doesn’t offer all of the alternative routes, e.g. when we want to travel through California Central Valley via 99 instead of I5, and go over the Grapevine rather than the eastern route. Also, voice directions often stop mid-trip even if no change in iOS or app settings. It’s still the most useful map app we’ve found for longer distances in well-traveled locations. Love the satellite &amp; terrain options so we can figure out what we’re looking at, etc.",0,
"I’ve been using Google Maps for a long time and I’ve never encountered any problems in the past, but today I had the worst experience. I was traveling to a place I’ve never been before and SEVERAL times the app gave the wrong direction. For example, it would say “keep left at the fork,” and when i look at the direction on the top it shows symbol of keeping left. But when you look at the map it shows you’re suppose to go right. The first time it happened I caught it in time and was able to get to the right. But then it happened again when I traveling back home and that time it was too late for me to get over. A few minutes later, it’s telling me to merge right about a mile ahead. So I continue to drive straight, waiting for the merge to come up. When I glance at the map, it shows that I should be getting off at the exit that I just passed by. The merge was suppose to happen AFTER getting off at the exit. How did it completely skip a step in the navigation?! Because I’m driving in an area that I’m not familiar with I try not to keep looking at my phone, so I rely on the navigation voice to tell me where to go and I only glance at the map occasionally. But how can I do that if the voice isn’t giving me the right directions? Very disappointed Google.",0,
"I religiously used Google Maps while doing a cross country road trip to meticulously maintain and log my travels. I have plenty of suggestions that are not currently in the app that I think would be of great use to developers for further iterations. 1) Options for a scenic route or scenic bypass vs fastest route.  Sometimes I want to take a prettier drive and don't mind an extra hour. 2) If I am choosing a more scenic route, it will continually alert me of a faster route available.  Limit this pop up to 2 or 3 times. Stop having it pop up every five minutes prompting me to click the X.  This is a hazard. 3) Allow me to make notes on saved locations or favorited locations.  I would like this functionality so I can remind myself of certain things (Ex: favorite food items at restaurants, coffee offerings at coffee shops, or spots for a sunset in national/state parks 4) Allow me greater customization when creating lists of saved places.  Why can't I choose my own icons for new categories? Why are all new lists defaulted to the teal color icon?",0,
"Hello, I’ve used your app everyday of my life for 9 years. Amazing and it’s made my life better. I drive to three different addresses a day to visit random customers all around my state. I use it to navigate to gas and food along the way. Some feedback I would like to request is to provide estimated cost for tolls on suggested routes. I’ve found that I’m out on toll roads for one exit making it almost pointless to enter a toll road. Or some option to only use toll roads if it saves me more than 10-20 minutes. There are also plenty of mislabeled exits. There should be a way to notify the app if there is a major issue that I run into daily where the gps puts me on the opposite side of the highway.",0,
I recently gave a bad review here and afterwards realized that I hadn’t tried uninstalling and reinstalling this app...it worked and everything is great again. I’ve used this app since the beginning and I’ve tried using the Apple maps but always switch back to Google Maps. The one thing I feel is an issue is sometimes it takes me horrible ways that are roads in horrible conditions and all I can say is I use it wisely and know it’s not an absolute best choice to just follow it...I have gone back to using my Rand McNally Road Atlas as a trusty companion coupled with this app. Rates 5 stars from me because it’s free and (mostly) awesome and it’s way better than the Apple maps (IMHO),0,
"Google’s Maps navigation app is by far the best navigational app there is as of now. With Waze coming in at a close second and Apple’s own navigation app not too far behind. It is the most robust, easy to use, and trustworthy navigation app in my opinion. I have used all three and even with the newest additions of iOS 11, I still have see my timing to some destinations in Apple Maps as incorrect. That raises an eyebrow. Waze is excellent as well, but Google Maps has information that is almost always spot on. Google has truly made something here that people will use for generations to come and it will only evolve into something better.",0,
"I have up until recently been using Google maps. For a while it was great. It has amazing features. For that I give it two stars. Now, however, Google has begun doing what it is notorious for... collecting lots of info on you... right in your maps app. My maps have begun recording search history. Google now knows where I go and when and stores this automatically even when I try to turn this feature off. Almost overnight my app goes from 112 gb to 500 or more because of this feature making it much harder to keep on my ipad. One time it went over a Gig. I am sad to say I am looking for alternatives now. This is just too much information and to much space on my tablet. For crying out loud, its a map app. Minus three stars for storing my travel history and making it hard to turn off!",0,
"I have never ended up at a road closed sign and had to be rerouted for an hour by Google Maps until today. My friend and I recently used this app to get from Marlinton, WV to Yeager Airport. The map took us a way that actually took us to a road closed sign in a campground. This put us back an hour to get to our flight. This was in the dark and there was no phone service (typical for West Virginia to have no phone service though). Thankfully the GPS of Google Maps still worked when I lost WiFi. It worked because I looked up directions when I still had WiFi before we left the house. We left the house at 1:00am and were supposed to get at the airport at 3:45am. We ended up getting there at 4:45am for our 5:35 flight that boarded at 5:05am. So thank you Google Maps for working when we did not have any phone service, it really was a blessing from God that Google Maps was still able to guide us! (It was basically just a map with the blue marker to mark where we were with no directions, but still helped a lot!) Though, can this problem be fixed? We should have known better, but this road closed sign should be updated for the future.",0,
"If you asked me several years ago I would swear by this app! It has never flawed my expectations, very aware of live traffic flaws and gave suggestions accordingly. However, since the summer my favorite app has Dementia, it has no clue where 75% the addresses are that I enter. To the point you need to backtrack and see which address it cannot locate, and then remove from your trip list. Which is where Apple’s Maps app picks up the slack. Why do I need to run TWO apps at the same time, to do one job I fathom?? GOOGLE PLEASE FIX WHATEVER YOU CHANGED BECAUSE THIS IS RIDICULOUS! This was the greatest of all times and then suddenly just started losing.. I just realized there was an update yesterday 6/4/19 now I’m arriving to locations that I am literally MILES AWAY FROM!!! Fix back whatever you did Google this this is ridiculously annoying now.",0,
"I am finding that google maps often doesn’t clearly identify the highways by number. It might identify by the road name but if one is not local and therefore not familiar with road names, it can be confusing. I have trouble building a trip with several stops. I would like to identify the distance travelled to each stopping point ending with the total distance traveled to complete the trip. Trips that originate in Canada show the mileage in Kilometres. I used to be able to convert that to miles, but I seem to have lost that option. I think all of these features were available at one but somewhere along the line, probably with an update, they have been deleted.

"I always use Google Maps for everything, especially when trying to figure out how long it’ll take me to get from place to place via bus. That being said, I really wish there was a way to add in more locations that are your frequent or specified places to go that’ll show up the same way that “Home” and “Work” do. I have two jobs (possibly soon to be three) and commuting between school, two homes, three job locations, and other places I tend to frequent on a daily basis is a bit inefficient as I need to be searching for them when they disappear from my recents. Having this feature would be helpful and efficient to my (and hopefully others’) daily commuting.",0,
"Google Maps is an amazing way to get to your destination. It takes you on the best route and even gives you suggestions to avoid clogged roads or construction zones. However, there are some simple things that would make my and other people’s experience better. For example, if I could write my own path to go somewhere, like a back way or a trail, it would help. Maybe I have a trail I have to follow that I always get lost on, what do I do? In addition, it’d be nice to be able to say “Hey Siri, take me to my home via google maps” Who knows maybe someone is driving. All in all, Google Maps helps you explore the world, but is missing some basic things that would make the experience much better.",0,
"For some reason the satellite view just turns completely grey or white. I have to zoom all the way in to hopefully get a to see the location. This just started happening in the last 2 months. It’s every single day but weirdly last week it’s t worked fine but now it’s back to the grey and white. I googled it and it say “your phone speed isn’t loading the maps quick enough.” That is not the case. I have a iPhone 10 with TMobile and I have done numerous speed checks and the speed Is always between 20-40mbs. I am more looking for advice from google on how to fix this problem. I have already tried reinstalling the app many times, tried factory reset on my phone, tried reset net work setting and also got a new sim cause I hear they can go bad. Someone please help.",0,
"Idk what happened to Google and Google Maps, but it took a nosedive and it’s no longer on my phone. -directions are no longer useful, and are inaccurate. Recently took a trip to New York, and we had to make about 20 detours (no joke) because of Maps not giving accurate information. This is on a clear sunny day with only google maps running. We lost about 3,5 hours of time with these mistakes and that is unacceptable. -while in New York, google maps randomly switched between “walking” and “driving” when giving directions. This is a a huge pain, becuase you think you are goin somewhere close (walking) and google has you driving 12 miles when you are in fact walking. Vice versa, you will be in the car driving, and google is giving walking directions, WITH NO EASY WAY TO SWITCH. -parking saving on google maps was a disaster. Multiple times it lost our parking place, and wasted HOURS of walking around tryin to find our car. -the heading direction (arrow) was consistently incorrect. We would be walking thinking we are following the directions, all of a sudden the arrow rotated and in fact we have been walking the wrong direction for half a mile. Again, unacceptable. Bottom line: do not use google maps if you want to spare your sanity. Trust me.",0,
"I honestly don’t care to have the shortcut bubbles on the front page of Google maps which help me get to places faster because they obscure my view of the map. If there were any possibility to remove them I would give the new update a higher rating. Actually, inserting these bubbles last week is the only reason why am writing this review and giving a one star. Also, I regret that Google has decided to remove from a previous (and old) very good version the ability to tap a small white bullet at, say a turn, so that you could see what street you would be turning on, or what freeway ramp you would be exiting, and only left the option to have to zoom into the map or go to the list of directions. I would appreciate it if these features were allowed to remain by giving one the option to select them in the settings.",0,
"A friend recommended Bleu Root to a big group of us going to lunch together.  While I like interesting flavors and am a little adventurous, I looked at the menu in advance and it looked a little too gourmet for me, like maybe not enough mainstream options. But I’m glad we went, because it was delicious! Although they had several soups from which to choose, their beef barley soup was there soup of the day. I’m not particularly a soup person, but I ordered it anyway, and it was delicious! Then I ordered a mushroom asiago flat bread that was also delicious. I would go back, and I would recommend. It seemed everyone in the group loved their food! And the service was very pleasant and helpful.",0,
"I’ve loved this app and have relied on it for years with no problems. As of the start of this year, however, it seems to be constant problems. The app is often locked up and doesn’t realize I’m moving, doesn’t know where I’m located (by thinking I’m located in a different place than I actually am) and, in a few instances, the screen has flipped upside down and wouldn’t flip back. Often when these would happen, I’ve noticed there was an update and I’d do that and the issue has been fixed momentarily. Idk what’s been going on lately but the updates just aren’t doing it. Since I’m on the road a lot for work, I really need a reliable app to get where I’m going and know how traffic is. Unfortunately, with the way google maps has been acting the last 2 months I may have to start using something else that’s more reliable and a lot less stressful to use.",0,
This is another gem from Google. It makes your life super easy by removing all the navigation hassle. Finds you better routes and ensure you reach your destination. However I don't understand why hasn't Google added the feature to show speed limit on the map when other apps like apple maps and Waze have this for long time. Please add it and It would add so much value to this amazing app. Another thing that I sometimes get annoyed with is that it will leave on the middle of a shopping complex's parking lot or the middle of the road without taking you to the exact shop or office you entered as destination. I hope these things will be addressed soon. Thanks,1,"Speed limits in navigation should be available in your country! Thank you for your patience as we roll this feature out. To use this feature (once it’s available to you) in the latest version of Google Maps just start driving navigation. In some locations, the maximum speed limit appears as a black and white box. In other locations, the maximum speed limit may appear as a red and white circle.

"I drive a semi-truck on dedicated routes, and use google to navigate other than an expensive truck specific GPS.  Up until several months ago, I could have maps open in the background and it would pause whatever I was listening to to give me verbal turn-by-turn prompts.  Then, without warning, all I can get it to do is give me a visual notification instead of an audible one.  Can we get that back, or if I’m missing something in settings, respond with how to fix it? Also, it would be great to get the ‘on map’ toggle between views again?   Now it is a whole hassle to go to settings, and then scroll down to satellite on or off.  The button is on the map before I tap “start”, why can’t it just stay there?",0,
I have been misguided by your App for about 5 times. Luckily I know the city. I can show your huge mistake. You can put people in dangerous if it is in bad area and nite. You can be sued if somebody is guided to wrong spots and suffer incidents. Do not complain later. I would do it for I trusted you the best way.  Also you place us to drive into toll roads and my son got ticket. He is stopping to using you.   Another annoying problem is forcing people to jump into the freeway. Let people choose streets if it please them for several reason. Cars problems is one of them.  Ex: New Year’s I did not want to take the 405 Fwy back home; the ramp was closed by the police and your map insisted us to take that ramp.  I tried to force to be rerouted but you declined and insisted on one way. The 405FWY is very dangerous late night in certain areas.  Learn about the places. Listen to the police and the community. They will thank you.,0,
"Though I was only able to live in this apartment community for a short amount of time due to a job transfer, this has been a great place to live.  From the office staff; Crystal and Melissa, to the new and clean apartments, to the beautiful views you get of the area, I was very happy.  I mostly used the work out facilities, that are very clean, machines first rate, and weight lifting equipment also new and clean.  They even offer training classes on the weekends, as well as many other community events.  If I ever get sent back to the Canton area, this would be the first place I would look to live again.

"Has been a great app, no issues until recently. I have tinkered with all of the settings I can find and have the app set to only access my location when the app is in use however I keep finding that it’s using location tracking well after the app has been completed closed. There’s been a few times where I haven’t launched the app in days and I will see the location icon, search my settings to see which app was using my location and it’s this app. I don’t want to completely disable it as I do use it for traffic detours on occasion. Otherwise no complaints. Great for directions, searching for businesses, and in my real estate research.",0,

I was thrilled. I have been showing off my new roof to relatives, friends and neighbors. All who saw my house before the new roof was installed can see the difference.

"I have been using google maps for a long time. It’s been giving me a headache recently. The sharing location feature is something I have to have to locate drivers and provide location updates for brokers.  Suddenly it has stopped sharing location with all of them. I have tried to add them back, but unsuccessful. My other friends have the same issue. My son and my husband tried to do location sharing each other for a good deal of time yesterday and is just not working. I have tried that too on my end and they will appear for a day or two or a couple of hours then they just disappear. No matter how many times we try sharing location again, it won’t work even though we set to share location to “ always “ .

"I’m going to be critical with this review. Every time I use this, it’s issue after issue after issue. When I’m driving and need directions, I would be on route and all of a sudden, it will say RE-ROUTING! If I miss a turn, it will take a solid 2-3 minutes before it comes back with a new route for me to take. Therefore, I’m driving without a clue where I’m going. There are times where I need the GPS (which btw stands for Gigantic Piece of Stupidity) to talk and give me directions and it won’t even tell me how long to stay on this road or turn here. Having me to take my eyes off the road (which we all know is dangerous while driving.) Either test your updates or demolish this app. It’s like a GPS for dummies. I wouldn’t give this app a star but it’s required so congrats Google. They better read this and the others. I was reading some of the others and clearly I’m not the only one angry.",0,
"This hadn’t happened to me until today, I have always loved the app but today I had chosen a specific route and in the middle of driving it said there was traffic and it found a faster route, went on to say that it would reroute to the faster route unless I tapped not to... obviously I was driving on a dangerous curve and couldn’t tap and so it rerouted me without me wanting it to and I just think that is so dangerous! Then I had to try and get it back to the route I chose while driving! It did it to me a couple times after as well but I was able to tap not to do it but that is not always possible. I tried to disable the rerouting option and couldn’t find the option. Please make an option to disable that feature, very dangerous and annoying while driving!",0,
"I use this app multiple times daily, as I'm a traveling therapist and rely on the time display feature on the directions view page to ensure I'm prompt to visits. It's too dangerous to keep swiping back to the map view to see my ETA when I encounter traffic. Please consider adding the time display back on the directions page. Another recent issue I have encountered is that this app does not remember recent addresses anymore. Are used to just be able to type in the street name, and the most recent address will pop up. While this may not seem like a big deal, again, I am a traveling therapist and drive to the same destinations fairly frequently. Please also bring back intuitive input for addresses.",0,
"All of a sudden, the app decided to ""clean"" itself several days ago. I tried turning the phone off and on, uninstalling and reinstalling the app- nothing worked. Finally, last night, it seemingly spontaneously fixed itself! It wasn't working for about 3 days. I'm so glad it's working, because I use it daily- SO MUCH BETTER than the pre-installed maps app! Still has some quirks for NYC driving. For example, it sometimes thinks I'm on the expressway, when I'm actually on the service road, or vice versa- it thinks I am on the street UNDER the elevated roadway or bridge, instead of over/on it- frustrating, but I don't know whether that issue can be remedied. Overall, still my favorite.",1,Sorry to hear about this issue. Can you try turning your device completely off and then back on?
"The app is great and everything, but there is this issue that I've been experiencing in the app for almost 1 year and I kept thinking to myself that ok obviously one day they will notice it and fix it, but till now, it hasn't been addressed. It happens occasionally that when I zoom in and out in the map view, and I'm trying to pinpoint or zoom in to a specific location, during the zoom process, the view glitches and the map view moves far away from where I'm actually zooming, so I have to zoom out to get back to where I was, and then zoom in again, hoping this bug doesn't occur again.

"I usually don't complain much but I live in Peachtree city and one of our main ways of transportation is the golfcart and golfcart paths. A lot of times, they can be hard to navigate and the only golfcart navigation app I've found doesnt even give you directions or to be able select a location to go to(all it does is let you put ""pins"" around temporarily). I know that most of us know our way around but for those of us learning how to drive it can be confusing and difficult, seeing as the town mostly looks the same from the golfcart path: forest and backyards. Please look into adding a feature for this? Thanks so much for reading. Otherwise this is a great navigation app. 😊",0,
"This is a first version of Google Maps which supports CarPlay. I was so excited to try it, on my Honda Accord 2017, but it did not go well... Two times the screen got frozen. Audio guidance was working, but the map was showing the same picture. Switching to other apps and back did not work either, so I had to disconnect my phone completely. Beside that, scrolling the map was not easy. You can do it when the car comes to a complete stop, but trying to scroll the map to check the traffic ahead is pretty dangerous when you are driving, as it requires a lot of attention. Another note is that I have not found an easy way to add a stop on my route (e.g. gas station or a restaurant). Hopefully it is gonna get better in next versions, but so far I am stick to Apple maps in my car.",0,
"I don’t know if they updated something to try and make their directions and routes better but honestly, it’s made it worse. I turned Google maps on during a rain storm to avoid any accidents that might be up ahead. So I trusted Google maps when it directed me down a different street than my normal route to school and instead of rerouting me to a faster route, I was taken down an even more backed up street. I ended up turning back around, going down my normal street and was able to avoid the mess Google maps was leading me towards. As I corrected my route, Google maps CONTINUED to try and get me to go around the other way. Because of Google maps, I wasted 10 minutes of my time and ended up going through a chaos just to get to my destination. I will no longer be using Google maps and do not trust it to take me to my destination.",1,Thank you for your review! Sorry to hear about this issue.

"Ever since we moved to a new city we have had nothing but problems with this app. It will do this thing when we first turn it on and it just turns the screen in circles over and over. When we get on the highway it is constantly remeasuring distances (instead of subtracting we’ll get to a certain point and then it adds miles to our exit). I was going to hobby lobby and got directions, when I was close all I had to was cross the street, your app had me getting back on the highway, going two miles up, exiting, and then turning around to get to it through the back way. I have a picture if you’d like it. Luckily we’ve gotten our bearings with our new city, but it was really hard at first trying to get to places.

"Love gmaps - puts all others to shame (I am looking at you apple). BUT, please, for the love of all that is holy, stop making us differentiate between the various global time zones (yes, it’s improved w/in the desktop browser UI, but could be better). Google knows more than Santa Claus, probably all the alphabet-soup of gov agencies combined (pun intended), or at least sooner, so why is “Estonia” and “Central West Africa” even popping up as options for me? I live in CST, I travel across N America most frequently - how about providing me the 6 time zones w/in N America at the top, with my home zone at the bottom (if I am selecting time zone, obviously it’s not my home zone - also, easiest to find the first and last on the list, ie, if my home zone is one of the zones I am looking for I know to drop to the bottom). Add a “more zones” link, with a space, below the initial list. It should be easy to query a users most frequent time zones over a period of time. Heck, provide an option for how far to look-back!

"When using the app to discover new places on the map make sure you don’t put your thumb in the lower right corner of the screen as it will inadvertently center you on your location, I have done this hundreds of times and it is extremely frustrating. Also when updating information on a place, there are many options missing when you search for them mostly transit or train station and there is no way to comment back to mother google that you have a problem so that is disappointing. But the biggest thing missing in this app is the lack of updating transit for newly introduced service and not showing the lines on the map. St. Louis, Kansas City, and many other U. S. Cities do not have updated transit information that would make the app more useful.",0,
"I have had to delete this app several times hoping that reinstalling it would make it work. The location I can’t when I start my route is over two or three blocks from my actual location. I used to be able to put in my destination and it would give me route options. Now I put in my destination and it wants me to pick up my current location before giving me a route. Then there is about a 10 second lag between putting in my destination, current location and waiting for it to give me a possible route. Even when I finally get through all of these steps the problem is still unable to be followed because the locator thinks I am either south or west from my actual location. I have checked the phone and reinstall the app several times. Nothing seems to work.

"Google maps used to be my go to as the Apple maps app always seemed to have problems for me, but now I’m left with no adequate map apps. Two main problems have made google maps unusable. First, after following a direction it takes waayyy too long to update the map and tell me the next direction I need, so I end up either scrolling ahead (inconvenient while driving and then when it finally realizes I’ve already done the last step it’ll update and I’ll be one step ahead) or missing my turn/exit. Second, some foresight in the instructions would be nice, in LA there’s often sections where you have to first be on the correct side of the highway then quickly choose one of 2-5 options. all g maps will tell me is which side of the highway I should be on without telling me what my immediate next move is, or tell me the name of one thing to indicate the general side I should be on then tells me I’m supposed to take a different ramp that’s impossible or would require a dangerous swerve. Add that to the first problem and you get the same result of missing the turn/exit. I’ve been waiting to see if an update would come out to fix these very irritating issues but none of the latest have done any good.",0,

"Over the course of about a month I have noticed this application not operating properly. I do service work out of a work van, so needless to say I am always on the go and I use google maps daily. But to get to the point, when I enter a destination it will be five the correct route to it, but it will then say it will take 2 days to get there. Obviously that is not the case because I don’t usually leave the state I work out of. I am forced to use the default apple maps application until this is fixed because I not only use google maps for the best route, I also use it to see if any particular way I want to drive has traffic at the time of my travel. I know you guys will fix this, but it is just a shame because I don’t like apple maps. ( Although I do like how they integrate the speed limit in the application, real time as you drive. )",0,

"This app is a waste of time. It finds ways to make you late to your destination. It has told me to go east on the highway for a couple miles, then tells me to get off and go west. In rush hour traffic. More than once! Another example: I was driving to a destination I’m pretty familiar with so I was spared this ridiculous task. Driving straight down a street and the app tells me I have to turn left to make a u-turn and make a left AGAIN onto the same street I was already on. Very frustrating. Sometimes driving down the highway, the app will apparently forget where it is and start navigating me in a completely different area for a few seconds and then readjust to the current location. It also will either repeat your next move 98 times or tell you AFTER you’ve passed the turn/exit/etc. Never a simple experience with this stupid app.",0,
"It’s a good app that is very simple to use. But aside from destinations, it also gives you the ability to schedule stops before arriving to your last destination. This helps when you have to drive long distances. It helps you find gas stations, food, coffee, etc...along the way. They have a review system that is good when trying to figure out what to eat or drink. Public transit and walking directions help a lot when you are in a city you don’t really know. The only problem here is that sometimes, the public transit routes aren’t visible through the satellite view. It’s inconsistent. For example, it always shows up for the city map in San Francisco, but when it comes to LA, it’s always a gamble. But you can always switch to the default view and it’ll show up. Directions are good and accurate. It shouldn’t leave you confused. But I think the best part is offline maps. Download an area when you have access to WiFi and then let it take you around. It works really well.",0,
"Google maps is the best way to get from point A to point B. It has more options and info than any other map app I’ve encountered. I would love if Google would keep adding. An addition I want to see is a “road trip” or “tour guide” mode, which will automatically scan your route for historical markers/locations &amp; fun facts, and give you a ten-second blip as you pass by, and an option to make a detour to it. That would be a great way to stay interested on your route, and learn something about history on the way. Also you could stop and smell the roses if you desire, making long drives more enjoyable.",0,
"We use goggle map. I often wonder how we got any where without this great app. One time in FL at Tampa it actually took me through turn after turn down town rather than the freeway. Is this because it might have been what was thought to be the shortest? In the same thought, we live in a small town, rather than using numbered highways nearby they direct through traffic down our small narrow streets. This is crazy and needs to be addressed. In the winter we have one man with a pickup truck to plow, very narrow streets then. In the other months children ride bikes, people walk,  the mailman stopping at boxes, streets may be made even more narrow by parked cars. Who would I address to get this fixed? Thank you.",0,

However, the amount of times I desperately need direction and the little arrow either isn’t keeping up with my current location or has me in a completely different area is kind of ridiculous.  It usually happens around the time that the app needs to be updated ... it’s like they do it on purpose.  But for two days straight now I needed directions and couldn’t get them because the location the app had me at wasn’t my current location.

I have to force close it to then get a new updated signal to start working again. As far as the update recently it still does not work as it used to be. The app itself does not know how to properly identity which way I am heading until I move more than a block and that’s an issue in heavy populated area as well as the constant updates it does not do. For example, I head down A street, but I see traffic that google maps does not detect so I turn into street B to skip 5 streets of heavy traffic and it does not update my path.

I have to keep turning the map right side up so I can follow it easier. Is there any way to keep the map or the pointer pointing upward so it’ll be easier to follow and know which way to turn. And lately it hasn’t been letting me know of a traffic jam or a back up from a wreck so I end up getting stuck in it. It use to let me know ahead of time and I can look for other ways around it.

Lots of respect for the quick fix and app update, and the response to my review. — Not sure what update changed this, but the primary reason to use the google maps over Waze was for the ability to save places and see them on the map. This was the best way to hear about a good place (food or otherwise), save it, and then remember it weeks or months later. Until this feature is back up and running, this app will be average.",1,"Thank you for your patience as we worked on this problem.

"I have used google maps for years and still do, but double and triple check the routes now after our family experience visiting Disney in Orlando FL.  After staying at a BNB nearby for our married children of four plus three grandchildren we found our routes were continuously changed to run down the busiest restaurant areas daily for the 7 days on our vacation.  When entering the destination it would always take the long route past all the restaurants and stop lights even after we figured out the best way to and from the Disney complex. Two of my son in law’s stated why does google send us through different routes every day to and from Disney???? It’s a scam by google maps who is paid by the industry to send the masses to return them the $$ they paid. This the reason why they bought Waze!",0,
I use google map all the time and I noticed it’s getting worse every week. It take forever to figure out what direction you are driving from a stop. Now I’m at a stop light and it reroutes me for no reason. It doesn’t take me to the exact location for residential homes but like a block away. I’m shocked to see I have to start using Apple map now for some location. Yeah I said it Apple map 😱.  Apple map doesn’t have all the bells and whistles but at least it it can locate me more accurately than google maps has lately. Fix it!! Update: It’s gotten worse. Just when I thought it couldn’t get any worse it does. Completely garbage now. If you have an iPhone I’d recommend using the stock map or Waze. Google map will get you killed. It literally could.  Told me to go up a street that was one way. Luckily I didn’t trust this app as j in use too.,1,"Thank you for your review! Sorry to hear about this issue.

"Google maps. Thank the Lord they exist!!  My husband states I can’t find my way out of a paper bag.  He’s right!  I alway have the same starting point for anyplace I go. If I go to the grocery store I start from my home. If I go to the mall from the grocery store I go home first. If I go to the gas station from the mall I go home first.  Not now, I just traveled by myself 400 miles to a large metro area. I scared to death I would go the wrong way. My city is 463 people. I followed google map through 3 states and here I am.  I didn’t get lost. I found motels. Gas stations and restaurants.  I was so simple to use. Thank you google I can start exploring and not be afraid anymore",0,

"Google needs to step up their game with the number of waypoints (stops) you can add. I planned the route on my computer and it only allows 10 stops. Not helpful at all for longer trips where you want to see many different areas. Also... when sending the map to my phone from their link...  I click the link on my phone that was sent from google maps... it doesn’t come up on my phone and only reads “ unsupported link”. My only workaround is to copy the webpage link at the top and email it to myself. It wasn’t 100% perfect though, even though I had dragged the route a few times to take specific roads that I wanted, it’s still left out a few areas. I was forced to do it that way because Google didn’t allow enough waypoints. I believe it would have come through perfectly had I actually been able to put all of the stops without having to drag the route. If somebody at Google is reading this, please add a large number of stops. I have read all over the Internet where people are wanting this feature. If you do add more, please don’t just limit it at something small like 26 as Other map apps do. Make it 100. There’s no reason to limit it.",0,
"…to screw up a perfectly good thing. Google undoubtedly got into a money squabble with Wikipedia (like Google isn't making too much money already) and—like the petulant, spoiled brat they are—decided to ""take their ball and go home"", leaving us without the embedded Wikipedia data on our maps. Google is either too stupid, too lazy, or (more likely) BOTH to research and input any data on towns—apart from that desperately-needed information concerning average wait times in a million restaurants 🙄—so we're left with the option of finding it on our own using the Wikipedia app AND Google Maps. Here's to hoping someone else comes out with a map app that (1) doesn't steal and farm out your private data to the highest bidder and (2) isn't so money-hungry that they need yet another billion dollars in their pocket before doing something their huge database of minions would like.

Previous review had issues with Bluetooth where I couldn’t re-find how to always play over the phone.  To Googles credit they responded telling me how to do it.  It is in menu -&gt; settings -&gt; navigation where the settings icon  in the right hand corner was missed because it wasn’t in the drop down list of items: The estimate to destination is extremely good except when there is a lot of traffic.  I don’t know how much the estimator uses previous days at the same time but they may need to increase history performance if possibly by giving a range estimate or something.,1,"Thank you for your review. Please try the following steps and see if they help solve the issue you're experiencing with navigation: Open Google Maps on your device and tap the Menu in the top left corner. Tap the Settings wheel at the top of the screen, then tap Navigation. You will be able to set your preferences for Sound &amp; voice by adjusting ""Play voice over Bluetooth"" or ""Play as Bluetooth phone call."""

"It’d be great if the numbers automatically loaded in the “search” field. It’d be more intuitive, as addresses begin with numbers, not letters. It’s taxing to toggle Waze’s intuitiveness but lack of search results with google’s accuracy and lack of friendly searching. Don’t you own all of it, mr. google? I use google maps when other maps aren’t accurate but then it makes me crazy to hit the “123” button ALL THE TIME. Also, it’d be great if my little car icon on screen was pointing the direction I’m going rather than opposite. Take a lesson from waze in that. I’m much more happy with waze than maps but it could all be so much better now that both are under the same org",0,
"I want to disable Explore Nearby from automatically opening, but I can’t. I use Google Maps 10-20X a day, and every time I launch the app, “Explore Nearby” wastes my time, multiple clicks, and mobile data to load and dismiss before I can begin to enter my search query. I know what I need to find, and while I appreciate that it might be helpful for some people, it should be a choice to use, and should at least offer an setting to disable. It’s not intelligent – it doesn’t learn from my search habits whatsoever, it’s not customizable, and I’ve never seen a useful suggestion in there. If I want to use this feature I can hit the explore button below. Please stop forcing it on me! It’s seriously making me consider using a less-obtrusive alternative.",0,
Why would you make reading directions for Google Maps when using Apple CarPlay mandatory. This is so backwards I need to be seeing the map and the street names not just the words. Why would I take my eyes off the road long enough to read an entire passage of directions instead of looking at the map myself while still viewing the street. You need to change this back as a mandatory requirement for CarPlay purposes because it is uncomfortable and also a waste of time when I need to be getting to my locations properly. I don’t Want to use Safari app or Maps or the unnecessary notifications from the Waze app. Sadly I will not be using Google Maps into you have made this change this is very unfortunate because I love using Google Maps I will no longer do so if this continues to be a normal thing.,0,
"I too caught East Valley Nissan charging more then what I was told.  They sent me a survey to complete on the service they provided.  I did not give them a good review but did compliment 3 employees who have always provided awesome customer interaction. Well, I just got a call from Christine in their customer service department and she let me verbally have it over the phone.  I barely said 4 sentences to her.  Christine venomously ranted on how she “was personally offended” offended by what I said on the review.  Mind you, I never even met this person Christine.  She constantly referred to me as “Hun” during her 5-10 minute rant and how she personally discontinued my auto butler service with this dealership.

"Google maps works great but everything can be improved on. What about a “Pause” button on navigation screen. Sometimes you know the first 1/2 of your trip but not the second 1/2. Input your destination, and hit navigate. Once it starts, you hit pause. This turns off the GPS temporarily and spares your battery. But not deleting your trip or destination. Once you get to the part you don’t know, hit “Un-Pause” the GPS comes back on it establishes your position, and starts navigating. Also, a simplified truck setting would be nice too.

"Google Maps, while it has been my “go-to” has within the past two weeks been sketchy. It continually doesn’t recognize my current location despite all my GM and phone location data points entered correctly. When I’m driving on the highway, GM will repetitively notify me of a re-route; I once let this happen for 10 notifications just to see how many times it would alert me before I got bored of it. GM also picked up the nasty habit of indicating when I should turn after I already passed the turn point. Thereupon, it will go into a re-route tizzy. I’ve had to continuously swipe the app, and or delete it and re-download it numerously. While it works fine on most days, it has been exceedingly sketchy as of late. 3/5.",0,
"After all these years Maps is still my go-to for finding just about everything. Greatly appreciate the clean easy to use interface. I not only use Maps for navigating and routing, but also it’s a respectable (sometimes superior) alternative to Yelp. A few features requests though: 1) Add the ability to create custom routes on iOS; 2) Add the ability to seamlessly share a business address/phone to Contacts - eliminate copying/pasting; 3) Add speed limit display with optional warnings; and 4) Please add adaptive font sizes for street names, i.e., when zooming in. It’s very frustrating to have to swipe all around to identify streets on tight zooms and still need to squint to read the tiny fonts!",0,
"This app used to be more accurate but now it’s giving me inaccurate times for bus arrivals, not taking in to account if a bus is early or late and the BIGGEST issue I have, is the app not accounting for detours, either temporary or more long term, it also does not mention if a bus stop is temporarily moved across the street or is out of service for some reason. Which has been quite an issue, thinking your at the right stop at the right time, only to find out your in the wrong place or your bus came early, leaving me to wait half hour to 45 minutes or an hour for the next, which Is highly inconsistent and inconvenient, especially when you use public transportation for work!",0,
"I used to love using the app, but then they got rid of the feature that lets you change the suggested route. A road I normally take to work is closing for construction, so I went online and planned out a new route for myself on google maps... then I sent it to my phone. The only problem is that when I click the directions that I sent myself through google maps, it’s just the original route- it deleted my alternate route! What the heck? Then I tried to redo the route on the google maps app, and apparently they got rid of that function! Why would you do that? So now whenever you put in a location, google maps literally gives you one route option, and that’s it. You can’t change anything! That’s ridiculous! I’m so irritated with google right now. I don’t know why you could delete that feature!",0,

"The Google Maps iOS app used to have transit routing for Beijing and China at large, but it was removed several months ago; please restore! It’s bad enough to that Google doesn’t operate in China to a great extent (leaving most Google Maps iOS app search result listings incomplete or missing entirely, not current or outright obsolete), but at least give us the transit routing as there are few English language resources in the China mapping app space, and removing the Beijing transit routing from search results seems pointless from the user point of view, while driving and walking routes remain in the search results. That doesn’t seem to adhere to the Google “do no evil” ethos,” and it works against the interest of the many English- and other non-Chinese language users in China. Thanks!",0,
"2019 update: Hey! Love the app, use it ALL the time BUT! pleeeaase allow for multiple layers! Many times I am cycling and would like to see an overlay of bikeways AND public transit. Secondly, please add distances to segments in multi-destination trips. Thirdly, back to multi-modal transit! Multi-destination trips, let users choose which mode for which leg! Would be awesome! E.G., I am biking to the beach, biking to the grocery store, biking to the train station, then taking the train to the potluck dinner. This allows me to plan the day, see the distances and times, and then SHARE the whole plan, via a link, with all who will join. Again, awesome app with so much usefulness.

So I have to drive to about 3 dozen places often for my job sometimes, so I use google maps and it seems to wanna take me the same way most of the time. These are main roads which are usually busy and not always the fastest since it doesn't show side road options. One of the good things google maps did was allow you to save these shortcuts, the only other thing I would suggest is allowing me to create my own routes and save them so I could make them before I leave and also be able to send these routes to my employees.

"More often than not Google Maps has been reliable.   However, on a recent trip to Colorado it was not.   In the Denver area, it gave conflicting directions.   We ended up switching between Apple maps and Google maps, closing out and reopening the app, and sometimes restarting phones.  Google maps usually does a great job rerouting if there is an accident or giving alerts of road construction or slow traffic, but may want to consider adding forest fires to the list.   The route it sent us on as fastest we found out later was closed due to a forest fire.  On the positive, we saw some beautiful country.  On the negative, we wasted a lot of time backtracking and did not have time for a sightseeing stop we wanted to make.",0,

"I usually like google. Today, it has failed me by guiding me into the 10fwy as the fastest way to Los Angeles when in reality, it was closed and I was stuck. I had an appointment scheduled and left with ample time that would have given me 30 extra minutes under rush hour conditions (JUST IN CASE OF EXTREME TRAFFIC FROM AN ACCIDENT).  But no, there was a police road closure that apparently had been set up an hour before I headed out. So why was there no indication of such traffic issues?  Good reception with internet, takes 8 minutes to reach freeway entrance, ample time to update traffic conditions... Because I wouldn’t make the appointment, it had to be canceled, along with the $200 deposit. If I had not used gmaps and went local for JUST 2 miles, I definitely still could have made it.

"I’m an iPhone user. Google maps is my map app of choice for at least 5 years. Until very recently ( fall 2019) I could use full screen route overview that allowed me to track my location on the map while checking traffic along the way without entering actual navigation mode. I loved this way of using maps because when I go to a place I know how to get to, all I need is live traffic update and route blue line for a reference. That is still possible, but not on the full screen which really is a waste of iPhone 10s potential and not as useful due to being just a half of the size it was. I’m pretty certain it is not IOS13 update - the change didn’t happen than, I believe it happened after one of the following Google Maps updates. So I would like to kindly ask the developer team to please bring the full screen route overview feature back, or maybe alternatively explain how to roll back the updates back to the version where it was still possible. Thank you for creating a great app. Konstantin.",0,

"This app used to be 5 stars. Now not so much. I still use it 90% of the time I need a map, however recently it has fallen much shorter. On a long multi-state trip home it wouldn’t even give the straight forward interstate travel as a route option, instead suggesting multiple ways of country backroads/highways. This took us roughly 30-60min linger over the day. It has also forced us to hit toll roads even when we have tolls off in the route options. The UI is becoming so cluttered it’s nearly impossible to just see the map anymore. I don’t need suggestions on a map app. I need a map.

"Not sure how a company such as Google could miss updating their apps to utilize the full scale of the screen on the X. One thing that has gotten worse in this app is picking the fastest route and providing accurate voice guidance. Usually turn by turn is off on at least one step telling you to go the exact opposite direction and even to the point of telling you to take a freeway South while indicating the city in the direction of the North is South. You ignore it and go the way you should, and then it has to reroute and can’t figure out where you are, or tells you to get off and turn around. If you zoom out st this point usually it’s telling you to go backwards but then showing the actual destination.",0,

I don’t need a preview of the route. You actually get a preview when you click the STEP button. It’s maddening that you’ll put in a route and it’ll go through this preview thing which is WORTHLESS when you’re looking for it to give turn by turn directions. This is why I don’t update Apps too often. Developers can over think something great that they created. This preview thing is useless.

I NEVER want this “quicker” route and and I have to stop multiple times to make the selection to not change the route, it is not only VERY frustrating but at times it is very hazardous.

"Big mistake, GMaps. You’re the best for directions, but Landscape view (turning your phone and the directions rotating with your phone) is disabled now, and that makes it really difficult to just put my phone on my dash when using directions. Edit for the developer review: I cannot believe that you would assume I couldn’t located the “Orientation Lock” within the Google Maps interface, but I did find the ability to temporarily fix this glitch by closing and reopening the app a couple of times. Your developers/the interns you force to write review responses should probably try not to place blanket views on problems that people report with your app and instead should attempt to address them by reaching out to users individually.",1,"Thank you for your review!

Some of these places are under construction so I understand those being a bit off but there are some that have been finished for at least 2 years. Lastly, when I pinch to zoom out it zooms but it. This drives me absolutely mad. Especially when I’m trying to just get a quick glimpse at routes when I’m stopped briefly.",0,
My father has been on medical marijuana for about four weeks now. he has rheumatoid arthritis and his hands are working better now than I have in the last 15 to 20 years. He also has myasthenia Gravis. Those symptoms have also improved greatly since being on the medical marijuana. We hope to totally get him off of his prescription medication for the myasthenia gravis soon. All this was made possible by IndicaMD. Dr Oconnell was great he didn't call just to get the money he actually called to check up and see how my father was doing and continues to call. Thank you IndicaMD for hiring such professional people. Thank you Dr. Oconnell.,0,
"I used to love this app as an alternative to Apple Maps. It always seemed to have all of the great features that Apple Maps had plus more. But recently, the app has been getting very slow on my iPhone 6s causing me to not be able to use it anymore. I would set a route to somewhere and once I got on the road, it would lag super bad and my location would only update like once every minute or so. And even worse, if I take a wrong turn, it’s so slow that it doesn’t even recalculate an alternative route. Please fix this app! I don’t know if this is just a problem with older iPhones or what but it’s really annoying. Navigation is supposed to be quick and snappy because you don’t have time to wait for it while you’re driving down the road. This app is now anything but that with the new updates.",0,
"It is absolutely mind-boggling to me that this app is rated so highly. After several years of misinformation and poor representation, I can no longer tolerate hours of my life wasted due to horrific recommendations by this app. Issue 1; traffic lights. The key word being traffic. Why is every route set back 5 or so minutes for each traffic light you stop at? How can an algorithm seriously not know that people stop at stop lights? issue 2; in 2 years I have never experienced reaching my destination in the remote vicinity of time that google projects. I realize no prediction algorithm is perfect, but I am rarely even within 20% of the projected time. I can understand this on very long trips with traffic, But I have experienced this even 5 miles from my home. issue 3; when google maps tries to be clever and take me on a 'faster' route, it ends up taking 10-20 minutes longer as several other people take the same route. Specificly painful when it sends everyone to the same single lane red light taking a left into arterial roads. Google has quite a lot of money and talent, so it is extremely dissappointing to see such an abysmally useless product. I hope they can do better in the future.",0,
"I love the app, use it every day literally because of the work I do but one thing really bothers me and I’ve contacted them and no response or anything at all. That problem being is when you arrive close to your location it switches around to match the location meaning it is not in the direction that I am driving and I have to guess which way the map is pointed. Big problem considering it heavily distracts my driving when approaching my location. Please change and stay on course as you do the whole time I’m driving. Also one more thing please stop suggesting other ways to travel to my destination because it’s near by, I drive. I DO NOT WALK!!!!",0,
"*update* With the new app update I was hoping everything would be fixed. My favorites are back and visible on the map but nothing else is working. I search for a place and I am constantly getting a msg saying cannot connect to server. When I click on places, no info pops up...it just buffers. Please fix the app. Why was it ever messed with? Until the last update, Google maps worked great. Now when I open the app I see the map but when I click on places nothing loads...no info...just a spinning circle. What gives? Why mess with something that was working fine? Hope they update again soon and fix all the things they messed up.",0,
"I needed my car to me shipped from AZ to Tx. No big deal with some, but for me it was a very enlightening experience. I had the pleasure of talking to Heather who helped me so much!!!! She took the time to explain everything to me and answer my million questions. I had several other companies try and get me to go with them saying that they was not a real company etc. I would look up that company, and see that they wouldn’t be fair or honest which for me is essential. This company is 100% real and  wonderful ..... stick it out and if someone has a question pick up the phone call and ask. They are awesome",0,
The navigation mode should be able to have smart auto zoom in and out based on the speed limit and distance to next turn. Often times the map is zoomed in too much while driving on the highway and has about several miles until the next exit. Drivers need to see the next few turns or the general direction on the map. Also the home page of this app keep getting more and more clustered. The actual map area is getting smaller and smaller. The map should be the focus of this app. Please don’t try to make it into something else as the primary.,0,
"I absolutely love the app. I have one feedback though. I frequently use the ‘Your Places —&gt; Maps’ feature to view imported locations (typically 50-60) on the map and helps me plan my week on the field. However, I am only able to draw driving directions to 10 of them. I usually have to go to 15-20 of them in a day. If there a way to include more than 10 places at a time for driving directions, please do. That will save people a lot of hassle in going through the driving directions procedure repeatedly. Except, for this, Google fixed a few bugs in using maps under ‘your places’ tab and seems to work great. Thanks!",0,
"Google Maps seems to have better street information than Apple Maps, but it gets totally lost when you enter a freeway using a carpool lane or express lane. The app doesn’t know where you are and goes into a constantly recalculating mode. Since I spend a lot of my freeway time in carpool lanes, this makes the app worthless for long distance driving. Update rating to 4 stars because issue with express lanes seems to have been fixed. Haven’t checked all freeways I use regularly so only 4 stars. Downgraded rating again. While carpool lanes worked once, it seems we’re back to the same problem. When in a carpool or express lane, the app constantly gives meaningless directions to “correct” you. Now it seems to be worse than ever. The “corrections” never shut up. I’m dropping this and going back to Apple Maps.",1,Thank you for letting us know about this issue. Are you still experiencing this on version 4.49 of Google Maps?
"My father n law lives at Lakeview. We are so happy to of found this wonderful facility. The staff, nurses and everyone who works there are always eager and ready to help.

"Our usual route from I-25 in Raton, NM through Clayton, NM to Dumas, TX is US 87. Recently, Hwy 87 was closed due to snow and ice. We had to continue south on I-25, and we planned to take US 84 (south of Las Vegas, NM) to I-40…our destination was Amarillo, TX. Shortly after continuing south on I-25, Google came up with an alternate route to I-40, with the note that this would be the faster route due to US 87 being closed. So…believing Google couldn’t make a mistake, we headed east. I do not remember the myriad of roads (some ice packed), different directions (all points on the compass: E, N, S, and W) we had to navigate to get to I-40. We stopped for gas in the ONLY town along the way, Roy, NM. I can not believe Google’s route was faster than my intended alternate route!!! And I image the drivers of the 20+ Texas vehicles in this misguided parade would agree.",0,
"So I wanted to do a simple thing: maintain a list of places I favorited and wanted to see together with my girlfriend. The use case is simple: Everytime I open the map I want to see all those places. Despite having two separate list sharing functionalities built in, THIS CAN'T BE DONE. First option is your regular Saved Places. Yes, you can share them but no one can contribute to it. There's also a  separate ""Shared"" functionality, which works fine except... you can't show those places on the map. So what's the purpose of it at all? Not to mention you can't add a place to such list directly from the place description dialog. You have to go explicitly to a list, search for a place one again and then add it. Ridiculous. Seriously, Google, how do you not see the utterly useless redundancy here?",0,
"Keeps showing this prompt and taking forever to load simple things even though I’m on super fast WiFi and sometimes even on the LTE it shows slow. How could the connection for simple shapes and addresses on a map app be more load-intensive than streaming Netflix in 4K without issues? I tried uninstalling and reinstalling again but the same issue stays. I expect better from Google, but this is the only job the app has to do (be quick) and it can’t even handle that. I’m also on the newest iPhone so that’s not a problem. Tried with an old iPhone running an old G Maps app on the same connection and that prompt NEVER shows up. Google messed something up in the newer releases. Fix",0,
"This is a very good app with great features that are comprehensive and easy to use. However, the “Remind me to leave on time” feature is the only thing that doesn’t seem to work correctly, or perhaps I just don’t understand it? I figured it would remind/notify me exactly when I should l leave to get to the place on time, but instead it reminds me 15 minutes before so then that leaves room for me to forget when I’m actually supposed to leave (which will happen more often that not). That is my only complaint but again perhaps it’s just me not understanding the feature.",0,
I always preferred google maps over Apple Maps but now I’m getting tired of all the glitches and starting to use Apple more. My biggest issue is when I enter my destination and hit route the app does stoped refreshing my starting point. It used to be that when I hit route and I approach my destination the app would constantly refresh and give me current estimated drive time and more route options. Now once I hit rout it just gets stuck. My location dot is moving however the starting point and time to destination does not even thought I’m getting closer to my destination. Also if I go off rout it seems to not even notice and does not update my route. To bad that with all these updates it keeps getting worse instead of better.,1,Thank you for reporting this issue. Are you still experiencing this?
"Hey Google, this  new feature  of For You and Explore Near by takes up about a third  screen real estate , and impedes the use of the map as a map.  Most of the time I'm using the map around work or home, I already know the parks and the restaurants. No need for your advertising algorithms to tell me what I already know, and annoy me that I can't easily use the map. I can't swipe it to hide it on an iPad or a Pixel when it's in landscape orientation, ( tho oddly can minimise it  when the iPad is in portrait,).  On the pixel the search bar takes up 20% of the map, even if you swipe it down to minimize it. C'mon Please fix this and allow us to be able to swipe this feature away, or make it a setting so we don't have to deal with being presented with info we already know, and use  the the map as a map.",0,
"I’ve been using this app for a long time and use it often as I travel a whole lot.  My constant irritation with the app is it never remembers my recent addresses ESPECIALLY the address I was just using or just searching.  I travel to a city and stay in a hotel.  I can navigate to that hotel a dozen times during that week, and the app NEVER remembers it.  I have to type it out completely or find it as a saved favorite.  The history feature is a fail and does not work.  It remembers quite random searches I’ve used over the past month.  I’d change apps if I didn’t have all of favorite locations saved already.  Please fix this.  Also, please get speed limits loaded on every street.",1,Thank you for your review! Sorry to hear about this issue with your Timeline.

"Google maps is always a part of my vacations. I live in Europe right now, and any trip we go on always involves driving, public transportation, cycling or walking. As long as we take the time to download area maps and review our itinerary for the day, Google maps is our tour guide once we walk out of the hotel. However, if we decide to stray or get distracted, Google maps is there to save us and get us back on route. Literally it is the difference between a difficult vacation and a painless, and worry free vacation as we are allowed to explore the city (any city) as a local.",0,
"Love the navigation. The app is generally quick and responsive. But if I want to check the directions quickly with one hand, going back is an issue having to reach the tiny back arrow in the upper left. You really should utilize the back swipe (left to right), or the pull down dismiss motion, to go back from this screen. The other issue I have is that it sometimes hangs for a couple minutes if I’m walking out of a place with WiFi and trying to pull up quick navigation as I get in my car. Like it wants to keep using the WiFi, and as it tries to transition, it just throws up for a while.",0,
"Until recently this app worked very well but over the past few weeks suddenly it’s terrible. I travel a lot and yesterday on a 6 hour drive I was messing with the stupid map the entire drive and ended up taking 45 minutes longer to get home. Notifications randomly stop working (which is a great way to miss an important turn) and I notice when I unlock my phone or switch back to it from another app it takes several seconds to “figure out” where I am, as if it’s not even working in the background. Sometimes it will actually crash (usually after ending a phone call). Also, if I go off my route it no longer reroutes me!! It will actually let me drive off in the opposite direction without prompting me or updating at all. This makes the app utterly useless! PLEASE FIX THIS APP. Downloading Waze now...",0,

I was not pressured into nor even steered toward the most expensive procedures.  I chose just to have an extraction at that time.  It was relatively brief and pain-free, and they even played my favorite music throughout.  I had minimal residual pain afterwards, which lasted through the next day.

"Google maps is the only application that has wholistic information across the globe. Undoubtedly this is the only one we can rely on. Unfortunately I am seeing issues in the recent years. I moved to Atlanta, when ever set navigation to the destination point, it guides me till that block and says “Your destination is on your right” and comes out of navigation. This is insane.....for a new comer to the city how can he find the appropriate point of interest in the block of shops? I have to immediately take the next possible right and look for the shop. In my hard luck if I couldn’t find it, I will pull over and search the location again and, tap the compass and virtually identify the route and then go to that particular shop. Earlier this wasn’t the situation. It would guide till the point. I though since Atlanta is a big metro, we are having issues updating in the google maps. I have been to LA, Denver, Dallas. In every other city, this is the situation. This should be a small fix in the navigation logic. Before your loyal customers move to Waze, please fix this ASAP!!!!!",0,
"I have used this app for the past 10 months because of its “my places” maps.  As a sales person, I used it to map all of my accounts so I can easily see where they are in relation to each other, and plan my work week.  Recently, it has not allowed me to see the pins I have placed on my map layer.  I try to click and unclick layers, and I get the same blank map.  Great way to start a Monday, to not have something I worked hours on show up when I really needed it.  The map layers still work on my computer, but I don’t use a computer for navigation.  Of course google has no real way to contact a human, just search problems from a list.  This is my fault for assuming that I could rely on an app that I didn’t pay for.  Not just disappointing but cost me time and potential commission.  Thanks google.",1,"We appreciate you letting us know about this issue, and we thank you for your patience as we worked on the problem. With the latest app release, this issue should be fixed and should now be working as usual."
"I love east of LA. There are multiple routes depending on the traffic and construction. However, there are only 2 main highways to start out. Google maps skips the I-15 route almost every time. Instead it gives 3 routes starting from the CA91 Highway. Which is great but what about the other obvious route. There are several times I take the I-15 route due to my own experience or gut feeling about traffic.  Google maps then re-routes to my destination. At times the new route is about the same ETA as the original route. However, there many times that the updated route saves me drive time. I wish there was a way to force a route, so can compare arrival times. *** The other issue I found lately, is that since I upgraded my phone to the iPhone X...  the auto rotate will note allow the map to be inverted.  This feature worked great on the iPhone 8. The invert app feature is helpful, so that I can leave the phone plugged in to charge while viewing the current directions. Otherwise, the port and charging wire take unneeded stress and ultimately become damaged.",0,
"I rely on this app for navigation 90% of the time, but I have found the transit predictions and suggestions to be disappointing. As someone who is often cutting it close, I find it annoying to be waiting 10 precious minutes for a bus that Maps is still saying departed 6 minutes ago.  I understand that the app is probably getting its data from the transit authorities, but why can I look up the next bus online or on the board at the stop and see a different and more accurate estimate? And why, when the software gets it wrong or there is an unexpected delay, why doesn’t the app update its directions?",0,
"Love the app despite its glitchy-ness at times. I use it daily. One of my favorite features is saving places in lists, I love doing this for local cool coffee shops, when I travel for restaurants I’d like to go to, attractions I wanna see. BUT THEY ARE ALL BLUE FLAGS. Which when I’m a new city is frustrating to have look at the map, and not being able to figure out when type of places/things are close by. Instead having to click each blue flag close to my location. If google offered different color options for flags for different lists this it would make this features a million times better, and its should be a super simple fix! 🙂",0,
"This app has been a great tool in my everyday work. The only upgrade or option needed is a truck option. As a trucker, there are certain roads that I can’t go on due to height &amp;/or weight requirements or steep grades &amp; narrow roads. Plus, adding the locations of weigh/inspection stations would be very helpful. If Google Maps can address this, it would be great. There’s been a lot of times where I’m following the maps &amp; have to bypass the turn because it isn’t truck friendly or you don’t find out that trucks can’t be on this stretch of road until AFTER you’re already on it.",0,
"I was looking for a shop to install a preventative maintenance item on my auto.  I found European Road and Racing on the website of the provided item as a qualified installer.  I called Karl and made an appointment for the following week.  I arrived on time and Karl explained the procedure and made me feel at ease as he pulled the engine and transmission from my car.  He cleaned the drivetrain while it was out and kept me updated on his progress.  He explained the procedure, installed the bearing and tested the engine oil for foreign debris.  He told me all looked good and made the change.  My Porsche felt good on the way back home.  Great shop, better guy.  Thanks.",0,

Best of all it gives you choices of routes and has never given bad directions or left me stranded. And google is improving the software all the time.

"I’ve always preferred Google Maps over other navigation apps like Apple Maps. However with my current and last phone, Google Maps can’t seem to function when I’m on the highway. It often misses that I took an exit and will “reroute” me to continue down the highway further. It also seems to think I drive sideways down the road or sometimes even backward (yep - reversing down 280 going 75 mph!). I used to think it was my phone, so I upgraded, and it still happens. I’ve even recorded my screen because it’s just so ridiculous. Considering I live in the Bay Area, home of Google, it would be great if the app actually worked to navigate me around correctly.",0,
"I don’t know if the glitch was fixed or not but today the app seemed to be working alittle better... for the past three days my car pointer on the screen was WAYYY far off when I was driving, I’m assuming there was a GPS(location) issue going on that was causing it but I noticed that as I was driving the app wasn’t keeping up with where and how far I was going until almost 2 miles after the fact. As an IPhone user I love and prefer to use Google Maps for everywhere I go considering I live in a large city, so I wanted to notify so that it can be fixed 🙂",0,
"Whatever this update is which makes the turn by turn directions pop up when tapping “start” then having to over extend my thumb, while holding the phone with one hand, to hit start again to get the gos navigation was a terrible idea that obviously wasn’t quality tests.

"Don’t get me wrong... I LOVE google maps! But it’s so frustrating how the settings or something changed. Any time I google and address and try to use the google maps from google, it has so many added steps that don’t even work half the time.

How else am I going to “google map” something? And when you push “navigate” half the time it doesn’t even work. Can you guys please fix these bugs?

"First, I didn’t have this problem until a a few days ago, around the time of the most recent update. I’m trying to use voice commands on iPad while driving - the iPad itself not through Bluetooth, while on cellular.  Voice commands in this manner work in Apple Maps, but not Google Maps.  Have verified that it is “unmuted”; Navigation Guidance Volume for Google Maps is set to “louder”; tried with Play voice over Bluetooth turned on &amp; off; etc. While the app works fine in actually giving navigation guidance, it is not giving audible voice commands.  Without voice commands this app is absolutely useless!!  Again all was fine until a few days ago - had no problem getting voice commands. Google just keeps shooting themselves in the foot.  Very disappointing!!",0,
"I love Google Maps. MUCH better than Apple Maps. And this new icon??? IDK WHY I LOVE IT SO MUCH!! 😅 Only thing I can say I’m not a huge fan of is when I find a place I want to go, it will tell me its 4 miles away, but then when I click “start” it says it’s 7 miles away. I get it. I get it. It’s “technically” only 4 miles away and the way streets and highways take me to get to my destination is going to be 7 miles, but I’d rather it not give me the “4 miles away” in the beginning and just show me the different routes to begin with so I know for sure how far away (or close) something is. Other than that, FANTASTIC APP GOOGLE!!!",0,
I have been loyal to Google maps for a long time even as an apple user. I only use Waze when using Waze Carpool for work but what I’d love google to do is capture the analytics of my trips. Maybe not for all but as an option. Often I drive to places for work and I need to know my mileage. I don’t always remember to set my tripometer on my vehicle and depending on traffic I don’t always go the same way so trying to calculate after the fact tends to lead to inaccuracies. It would be nice to get a summary post drive to include total miles driven and number of tolls. Thanks.,0,

Apparently there’s some app called wayz or something that people really like too but I haven’t tried it.

"An update to the app will now constantly update your route to “the fastest” way. I had put in the route I wanted to go from Connecticut around on I84 so as to avoid inevitable Stamford, nyc, New Jersey, philly, and DC traffic going south. Multiple times google maps changed to put me on the route that went through all of these resulting in me being in stand still traffic for hours. Apparently it will update your route after it says “there is a faster route available would you like to switch” or something along those lines but will switch anyways unless you dismiss this notification which I never heard.

Not sure what happen to google maps. I use it very religiously for finding my way to work or home. Maybe it’s a user error but every time now that I open my Maps I have explore nearby. I’ve tried looking through settings changing different things can’t find the off button. And then now if I select my commute instead of it giving me multiple routes and a large map to see what route to take. I get a very tiny map screen and only two options to go.

I’ve tried deleting it and reinstalling it on my phone but it goes back to the same thing.,0,
Ok for starters I switched to google maps because I always loved its reliability and innovation. It’s still good but when it comes to CarPlay it’s missing a couple features already present in Apple maps. 1. Needs to show the speed limit. This is a very useful feature specially when driving out of the city limits. 2. Show more route suggestions including at least two without the toll. 3. Offer to find places of interest while driving to a destination. All of this needs to be present on the screen of the Apple CarPlay. I shouldn’t have to hold my phone in my hand to get this working. Hope to see these features soon!,1,"Speed limits in navigation should be available in your country! Thank you for your patience as we roll this feature out. To use this feature (once it’s available to you) in the latest version of Google Maps just start driving navigation. In some locations, the maximum speed limit appears as a black and white box. In other locations, the maximum speed limit may appear as a red and white circle.

"Have been a big supporter and user of google maps since my first iphone. But these last couple of updates 👎🏽. -1. This tilt map is cool if you want to use but VERY annoying when you don't want to. You can turn it off but the map defaults to north up rather then up being the way you are traveling. (* would be great if u could choose to default direction traveling/going as always up; even in the route selection overview/""zoomed out""; and not having the map spinning all the time😠) -2. Would be nice to disable the ""route is clear"" when starting. I don't care. I chose the route. I've got to go on it. Clear or not. Yes when I'm on my way and another route becomes a faster option, do let me know, but stupid otherwise. -3. Map taking too long to load. Seeing a lot of black pieces. Wouldn't mind seeing it in layers first as loading, i.e. Streets, then route, then name, then satellite, then traffic. -4(update) would it be possible to disable the notification that a place might be close when arriving. I often travel at night and am well aware a place is closed. Therefore that additional step is an added distraction that is unwanted! Thank you. Please fix!!!",0,
Look I get it that Apple and google don’t play well together but google maps is far superior to Apple Maps. The only reason google maps is not my all around go to map and navigation app is because there is no Apple Watch app. It’s so nice to have the directions on my watch that I start on my phone because it means I don’t have to look at the phone while driving. If Apple Maps allowed me to add stops to a single route I’d honestly compromise and exclusively use that one but google maps is better. I just need an Apple Watch app that sends directions to my wrist and taps me when I have to make a turn or other driving maneuver,0,
Michelle Duhon /Bayou Preservation’s did a major repair for me on my family Tomb in Lafayette #1 cemetery across the street from Commanders Palace in New Orleans LA. This cemetery is import to me and is a tourist destination for many visitors to New Orleans. Her knowledge about the time period our tomb was build and information she offered about its history and architectural details were impressive and quite helpful. We are extremely happy we chose Bayou Preservation to do the repairs !!  A year later she still manages to check on our tomb and updates us on its condition. We truly appreciate her extra efforts as we live out of town presently. Judy &amp; Fred Derbes,0,
"I have been using Google Maps since I got a phone. I’ve tried other apps like Waze and stuff but Google Maps just does it for me! So easy and helpful! I’m a local tour guide on there so I post reviews for places a lot. It’s honestly just a really helpful app for traveling or distance tracking. Even if you’re a backseat passenger, it’s really good to check how far away you are from the destination without pestering the driver. Not only that, but if you need to quickly look at reviews for a place, Google Maps provides so many that customers have sent in. Thank you Google Maps!!",0,
"Edit: I wrote the review below in early July. But in late September, the ""swipe to see the next turns"" came back! Much much easier to use and read than the tiny previews. Thanks. Previous review: Please bring back the ability to swipe to see the next turn. I use this all the time. Also, the new static previews are too small, they don't have map context, and they don't stick to north-pointing. By taking all this away, you took away half the functionality, so I'm taking away two stars. I'm reluctantly hunting for a new map directions app now.",0,
"Let me start this off with the fact that I love Google Maps. I will only use this program when traveling. Although, I recently ran into a problem with the re-routing process that (I am only assuming) runs when you have just come out of a‘No Service’ zone. I was driving home from Thanksgiving (VA to IN) and had to cut through KY on 64W. Google Maps took me off of 64W onto a bi-way, which is fine, but I hit a ‘NoService’ pocket for approximately 15mi.  After this, I was re-routed in an hour-long loop before I could continue on my way to Indiana. I don’t know if there is any way you could add a line of some sort to fix this bug, but I’m sure this is not the only area that has this issue.",0,
"Let me start out by saying Google maps is awesome if you using cellular data for it. If you use the off-line maps, it’s extremely slow and does not work half the time. It keeps saying it wants to connect to the Internet, even when you have cellular turned off for the app. Another downside of Google Maps is if you do not close the app out it will usually keep running in the background which drains battery.  Sometimes when I come up on a turn usually the app will let you know that the turns coming up but sometimes it fails to do that and I just drive right past the turn.  iPhone X",0,
"Overall I love Google Maps, but for a company that claims to be embracing artificial intelligence I cannot fathom why Maps cannot learn my preferred route to work. When I veer off Google’s options I find myself in what it must see as no man’s land. I have taken the same route for several weeks 5 days a week. You would think that Maps would learn that this is the route I want and at least offer it as an alternative. But no. If I want to continue navigation I have to stop the trip and restart once I have turned onto my preference. I really just want to see what the traffic looks like ahead. I already know how to get to my job.",0,
"If I had a dollar for every time Google Maps changed course during the navigation, I’d be a rich person. It told me to go into a restricted area at Reagan National Airport, and I got pulled over and now have to pay a $140 fine. After that, it just kept directing me in circles, re-routing again and again and again, back to the same place I got ticketed. Then when I directed it to get me back to Virginia, it kept sending me into DC. Wasted my time, gas, and some money. Screw you, Google! Even Apple Maps does better than this dumpster fire of an app. Funny how that happens when you have one company (Apple) who is dedicated to making quality software and hardware, as opposed to a bunch of children who care only about data mining and keeping things in beta (Google). Anyway, everyone is better off using anything *but* Google Maps.",0,
Use this everyday for work. However this newest update has really messed up the navigation. It freezes in mid drive and when it finally catches up I’ve missed my turn. And the arrow that shows where you’re at along the route...it now points all directions and goes way off the route when I’m in fact still on the same road. I know it is not a reception/service issue because I’m traveling in the same areas I’ve been in for 10 years and haven’t changed providers. It only started happening when I updated this past week. I’m hoping for a new update to fix these issues.,0,
"You used to be able to search for a store, pick the one nearest you, hit their phone number or their website. I no longer see either of those options. Now you have to go to your Internet app, type in the business name, go back to google maps, type in the business name, find the address of the closest one, back to the internet, find the one closest to you based on address, get their phone number, and then you can call. The most useful feature (for me) has been either removed or hidden. I can’t believe I’m saying this, but it looks like I’ll have to switch back to Apple maps.",0,
"I love this app.. except for toll roads. I used this app in the Philadelphia area and it directed me to a toll road (which is fine), but the entrance for the highway was an “easy pass” entrance only. I did not have an easy pass (it’s something that you have to pay extra for, not everyone has one). And I was in a lane that I couldn’t get out of and forced into this easy pass entrance only. So when I could finally get off the highway, I had to pay the highest toll, because I didn’t have a ticket. That’s because I got on at easy pass entrance. So, I had to pay $40 for a Google mistake. Thanks 😕. Besides this, I love the app, but please fix this issue.",0,
"Latest update is HORRIBLE!!!!! Don’t these updates get tested with real people using them first? Your latest update has placed the turn by turn directions (used to be upper thin bar) and Route bar (used to be bottom screen bar) .... on the left of the screen in enormous bubble boxes! They take up the entire left half my iPhone 10XS screen, and what’s worse, forces my “arrow/vehicle” way over to the right, traveling on a road that I can’t see where it leads, because your app pushes it off the screen. This is horrible, please bring back the old look with the info bars thin and at the top and bottom of the screen in landscape mode. Why anyone would think this new format would make sense is beyond me. It’s pretty much useless now because I cannot see my info.  I’m so frustrated.",0,
"My phone is in English, so I have no issues with Google maps there. My iPad, however, is in Russian, and I couldn’t find a way to change the language of Google maps to English. It would be fine, but for some reason, the app translates street names into Russian, making it impossible to find addresses I need. For example, East Chestnut Street is displayed as “Восток Честнат-стрит.” So it translates “East” and transliterates “Chestnut street,” which is not only useless but makes it impossible to orient myself on the map. I couldn’t find a way to submit this comment to the support team, so I am writing about it here. Please get rid of this automatic translation/transliteration of places in the native alphabet, or at least make it optional. Thanks!",0,
"First of all, I like the app enough that it’s the only navigation app that I have on my phone.  That said, there are a few glitches I think need to be addressed.  Here are some of them, not necessarily in order either. I ride a motorcycle and listen to the directions without viewing or being able to manipulate the screen.  It would be nice to customize each leg of my route at each turn so I can then have the option of getting there fast or getting there through all the scenery before I start riding. The app goes into some sort of repetitive sequence when I enter the EZPASS lanes...why is that?  The direction of traffic is the same, and I’m literally a lane or two over from where the app says to be.  Would be nice if this were fixed. The app will often take an extended route thru a neighborhood then straight to the destination...this is especially frustrating when I have no control over where the route goes.  Again, would be nice if all routes were able to be adjusted at each turn. Thanks for reading, have a great day!",0,
"I don't know what you guys did to the Maps algorithm but it's working terribly. It's been consistently showing longer and more circuitous routes as the primary suggested route when shorter ways are available. I use the app a lot during my long commute to gauge traffic and several weeks ago the app stopped showing one route-a rather obvious one that often used to be shown as the fastest. It's not even shown as an alternate similar ETA route now unless I manually override. Sometimes the app suddenly recalculates and changes routes in the middle of driving for no apparent reason, shifting to a longer route with worse traffic. When the route is manually overridden back to the original route, I can see that the original route still takes less time. Please tell me you have a fix in the works!",0,
"We recently used All-Pro to help us prepare our home for selling. We were very pleased with every aspect of our experience. TJ was very prompt in calling us for scheduling an estimate and was quick to reschedule our dates of service, even with inclement weather a factor. Oswaldo and his team were very friendly as well as courteous during the service. We could not be more pleased with the job itself, very professionally done and the price was reasonable and fair. Thank you TJ and your team for giving your industry a ""good name"" to call upon for help! We would recommend All-Pro to our friends for sure.",0,
"I have use Google maps for years. To me is the best tool for navigation and exploration while on land. Besides finding your way and getting directions like a GPS, Google maps is also a great companion when traveling to new places. You can save your favorite places ahead of your trip, check reviews of restaurants and places you want to visit, and find your way around the world. They information is correct most of the time, but you can also contribute and help improve their database. Never leave home without it! Great job google!!!",0,
"Well ! Hey! I was recommended this place by my coworker. I did a couple of calls before to other places and I was told “ for you, young lady we will do $850 for 4 tires out of the door”. Really? You think young lady is stupid? I am not a pro in cars but the approximate price for a brand new tires I know. So, I walked it to the place that I was recommended TIRE CHOICE. The guy over the counter, Anthony, explained me everything kindly, answered to my 100 questions, showed what kind of options I had had, and  I got new tires in 1 hour. I paid around $500 and I am satisfied with the service so far. Let’s see how the new tires are on the road! 😉",0,
"Glad to see my maps pins functional again. For anyone old enough to know what it’s like to navigate without a powerful app like this, it’s hard not to give a 5 star review, even if it’s not perfect. Ah yes, the good ole days of paper maps and making sure you had enough spare change to call from a phone booth for directions. Also glad to see speed limits on the screen. Not sure why it took Google so long to add this feature. I highly recommend the youngsters reading this practice navigating old school with paper maps and keep one in your vehicle.",0,
Ive had this app for years and i use it everyday. It is a GREAT map. But dont ever use it as “live navigation “ it WILL lead you astray. It WILL reroute your trip without you knowing.. drove halfway across New Hampshire the wrong way. I had a nice scenic route planned.. another time the navigation was leading me off a 50’ embankment in providence Rhode Island. The most aggravating this is the fact that it Almost Always switched from auto to walking navigation... some locations show walking only and some show auto. How the hell do i lock it on auto navigation? and why the hell does it always do that? Its a hunt every single time to switch it back to auto navigation.  Thats just to name a few. But what am i telling you for? If you have had this app you know the struggles.,0,
"We had tickets for a tour and despite leaving 45 minute margin, due to the app over 100 euros went down the drain. The problem was the app was useless for making a transfer from a tram to a bus because it kept refreshing and indicating different buses at different locations up to 500 m away to transfer to. We were going from bus stop to bus stop with constant updates and revisions. We lost all of the 45 minutes plus more and arrived too late. The fix would be to have. Lear walking directions from one place to the next and not constantly update en route. Furthermore the indicated tram stop turned out to be not the closest or most favorable resulting in even further loss of time. The app may work adequately for driving in the United States in a private car, but is worse than useless in Italy.",0,
"I’ve been using this since it came out and it was helpful whenever I use public transportation. But when I tried using it when I was on my way home on Sunday, my regular routes didn’t show up, which is weird. I’ve never had this problem before and I’ve tried everything that I could do to fix it( clear settings, change the addresses etc.) but nothing seems to be working, the only thing that I haven’t done yet is delete the app and reinstall it again. I use other public transportation apps also but it’s to compare timing to this app and see which one is more accurate but I use this one more often and I would like for it get fixed or at least someone can help me find a solution to fix it.",0,
"It is very often that when I started the navigation, I can hear the voice. But when I start driving, the voice navigation stopped without any notification. It is very dangerous to operate phone during driving, and I have to find a park to reset the program. I also have to check the phone whether the navigation is stopped during driving. It is very dangerous and I am very angry about it. I think it is only the software design fault. Google map want to download the voice but there is no network, so it stopped waiting for network, and without any voice notification. It is very dangerous to draw the driver's attention to the gps faults, and google map is keeping doing it. It is very unrealiable, you should withdraw this app because driving navigation must be safe.",0,
"I loved Google Maps and would only use it over all other maps apps. After the recent update, I’m VERY disappointed. Now my Google Maps has no idea where I am. It’s always has me facing a different direction, so the directions do not match the way I’m currently driving. Or instead of thinking I’m driving straight on the current road, the arrow starts to stray off and the Google Maps has no idea where I am. Also recently, it can’t seem to catch up to my current location when I open the app. Instead it always seems to be behind— like at the location I was 2 minutes before I opened the app. To get it to be at my actual location, it requires rebooting the app several times. It’s definitely not what it used to be and not helpful while you are the road trying not to get lost.",0,
"Need to bring back fearure or option to always have home and work show up as choice to navigate to when navigation button is pressed. These are places navigated to often and it used to always be available to choose. Now I have to start typing it in which can be annoying and frustrating when search bar jumps around as I’m typing in w for work it shows up and when I go to press it, turns to Wok industries or some other place that starts with wo. So then I have to back out of navigation and enter it again. Not easy to do if already started driving. Please bring back home and work as options when searching navigation destinations",1,"Thank you for letting us know about this issue, and your patience as we fixed the problem. We appreciate it! With the latest update, Google Maps should now be working as usual."
"I have this as my number one choice for traffic updates on my drives. There’s only a few things that can be quite frustrating. First, it will automatically put me on a different route than what I chose while I’m driving. I chose the route I want to take and want it to stay that way. Which leads me to my second complaint, can’t we have the option to turn the suggestions for a different route off or on? I hate that it pops up and I don’t have the time to reach and choose “no thanks” while I have my hands on the wheel. It’s extremely annoying. Lastly, when I try to zoom out slightly to look at the route farther along, it will just zoom back in!",0,
"Used to be a great app, I don’t know what happened but I try not to use it very often anymore. A few venders told me their addresses are always reversed so that clients can’t make it to their stores. I have seen that and believe it is because they are not paying google for advertising. Also navigation when roads are closed doesn’t get updated anymore. In Santa Barbara there are closed roads but the app directs you to them anyway. The roads have been closed for 6 months now but still. When I used it last hoping to save time, I lost 40 minutes extra in a 35 minute drive. Yes it took 75 minutes to go 15 miles because of this app. Use another app Waze. It updates regularly and has some other great features",0,
"I like Google maps much better than any other map app out there BUT one thing I wish they'd do, is give us the option to SAVE a familiar route rather than ONLY faster routes. So if I've traveled lots and I find a road or route I prefer and am familiar with, don't give me options that don't include it. Let me SAVE it and use it whenever. Some roads we forget where to turn. Highways we forget we took. So if we're able to SAVE it, we could use that route any time we choose rather than Google tell me which to use. I hope I'm making sense with my explanation. Thanks for your consideration. Fingers crossed we get this option 🤞🏼",0,
"The most frustrating thing about this map is you don’t get alternative routes, who in their right mind would go through Boston to get to Attleboro instead of using 495, the difference in time is maybe 5 minutes because of the slow traffic through Boston unless it is night.  Also for years I lived next door, after asking for a fix I now live down the road about 5 miles in a tree since there are no buildings there.   I thought to get around the route problem by using the computer version and then sending it to my phone, but guess what, any drag and drop changes are not transferred to the phone, so it is their route or nothing.   I like to have the notices from my phone when I am on a long trip, but guess that is a by gone thing with the last two updates.",0,
"- when we select No Tolls, google maps will auto change directions to a toll road even if it’s only 3 mins faster. Please google, No tolls means no tolls. - the constant auto direction change is also very frustrating. Even when we press no thank you on the recommended alternative route it will ask us the same exact question 2 mins later. - the older version on google maps would allow us to choose 3 alternative routes, quickest, shortest, and no toll routes. Please let us have the option to turn this feature back on again. It’s frustrating that google maps will make us take a toll road over a non toll road even if there is no difference in time of arrival. Common sense is that most people would rather not pay $10 for absolutely no reason.",0,
"Google maps is the most powerful tool in the map in navigation service. Free for users and paid by the business and advertising. Features as traffic updates and predictions routes make the users take alternate routes while driving and helps for less traffic jams. I have been using google maps since 2012. I allow Google collect all my location history, that way it is fun when I can go back in time and see what was my location and what time I visited a place. It is fun to use google maps service. Thank you Google.",0,
"Good bye perfect app, now the app too is going down, looks like i have to almost say  goodbye to google all together. Near me around me all crap to sell you something. Even on the main platform, when you needed knowledge just googled something it was the best way to learn a Wikipedia without going to Wikipedia now is ALL about sale, I understand need to earn advertisements money to keep the doors open, but it would be nice to see mixed opinions, advertisers and jest plain simple research. Now the app is more and more towards that way. Too much focusing on sale and advertising, but at the same time forgetting about the reliability and the purpose of the initial ideas of google maps and driving. I hope the company steers back to the original idea. Good luck for now Jimmy.",0,
"Something is wrong with the zoom feature and the menus. When using two finger zoom sometimes the map flies off to some strange location that was not centered before. Very frustrating. Also, when clicking in the middle of the map to get rid of the menus after searching for something, sometimes it thinks I’ve clicked on a point and highlights that and removes what I’ve searched for and re-centers the map on this useless point. For some reason maps has become non-intuitive and has these strange quirks mentioned above that make its use very frustrating. Even though I’m a long time Maps user I’m becoming disenfranchised and actually reinstalled Apple Maps the other day. I’m using an iPhone XS non-plus version.",0,
"I love Google Earth on a PC. It is amazing to explore places, measure distance, see into the past, and much more. But, the iPad app does very little of that.  The images are at least two years out of date compared to the the Google Maps app or the PC version. The images seem to be rendered to give a 3-D feel, but this obscures details.  Much of the functionality is missing too, e.g. Measuring distance or path, viewing older images of the same place, etc.  I prefer to either use the PC version or use Google Maps.  Maps has more up to date images and great search functions. So, the Google Earth app doesn't add much or anything to that.",0,
I had recently lost my job but just started a new one and was in desperate need of a new car because I had twins and was outgrowing my car with my family of 5. NO ONE....I mean NO ONE would approve me. A friend told me about Velocity and how willing they were to help those trying to rebuild their credit and gave them a loan with not so great credit so I took a shot and they approved me for a new car loan! I couldn't believe it. I will NEVER get another car loan from anyone other than Velocity. Not only for the approval but for the everlasting relationships I have made with the team there.,0,
"Eventually I get to my destination, only after it gets me lost a few times, I have to make sure I leave with over double the time that this app tells me I need, not even exaggerating when I say that it doesn’t update my location after I press start to navigate. This is the worst app I have ever had the miss pleasure of needing to have on my phone, it’s essential so I can’t get rid of it but this app is also the sole reason why I’ve broken 4 phones, i can’t even drive to the same place once or twice and learn the way there, so I don’t need this app, but this app makes me drive 100 miles for a 60 mile trip (not exaggerating), so I can’t learn the right way and I need to keep using this app and because of that I’ll keep getting lost and keep breaking my phones, it’s just a big pain and a huge waste of money.",0,
"The update previous to this made an ""improvement"" which now inserts names of parks, restaurants, businesses, etc. on the map.  The problem is that they block the traffic info and sometimes the street informtion on the phone screen.  It's not so bad on a tablet, but I use the app on my phone much more often. I'm sure this can be valuable information for many people, all I would like is for there to be an option to turn this information off.  I've been unable to find a way to disable this in the settings. Other than that new function, I love this app, it's a must-have.",0,
"Google maps has become a bloated data sucking machine that you can’t really log out of if you have other google applications.  Come on Apple, these apps need to be sandboxed from each other. The user interface has become less useful and more about how to direct you to places that are paying for the privilege of showing up first.  This kind of degradation in the user experience is the beginning of the end for an app. I’ve switch to Apple maps now because it does what it is supposed to well.  It doest have the army of people that google does that are fixing the locations of everything perfectly, but it’s an overall better app.  I use Apple maps most of the time and then google maps is my backup of some data is wrong.",0,
"With so many updates, google maps is no longer reliable. In a straight away it sends you to do a neighborhood dance that adds 15 more minutes! I had my girl go the route goggle maps guided her through and I went my way. Not only did I get there first, the 30 minute trip for her too her 42 minutes! This is not an isolated event! To test it out I set a direction to a supermarket a mile away, it routed me through the neighborhoods taking me through area which there was no need to go to!!!! I’m done with this app! The Apple map that came with the phone is MUCH more accurate! That’s my story, something isn’t right with google maps, and I’m done with it making me late when I punch in an address!

"I have used Google Maps for the past 10 years and loved it, swore by it, and encouraged everyone else I knew with an iPhone to use it. However the past several months, it’s consistently delayed showing the next turns when navigating, buffers, freezes, gets disoriented, starts the trip directions over, etc etc etc. I am on the road frequently for work, &amp; this has caused me to be late MANY TIMES. I’ve finally given up and quit using it. Nothing is more frustrating that driving in a metro area, merging between interstates, and then looking at your Maps navigation freeze up, not know what to do next, and as soon as you pass an exit it it loads and tells you to take the exit you just passed. In fact that happened to me THREE TIMES in the past 24 hours. I give up.",0,
"I love this app. I have an iPhone and still download and use this over Apple's Maps. I will say, it has been glitching on occasion and not voicing directions, but that hasn't been too much of an issue for me. The only thing I wish about this app is that I could see what the average estimated commute time would be to my destinations at a certain time of day/rush hours/days of weeks, etc. I would thing google has the data at least. This would help us all plan how to make it on time to our off-site ""team bonding"" work meetings as we venture into traffic unfamiliar.  It would also earn you 5 stars from me. 🙂",0,
"I’ve found nowhere else to be as complete a source for maps, imagery, and potential as this app which is so unfortunately overshadowed by paid placement strategies masquerading as features. The explore tab, that slings itself into view like a pop up ad and shows you the businesses in your neighborhood that have paid for preferential listing, every time you open the app. The scroll bar of suggested topical searches now permanently affixed to the top of the screen while you’re showing your friend satellite imagery of a backcountry campsite just in case you want to search for the nearest restaurant to the pristine glacial stream you drank out of for a week. These design features were previously less intrusive and non-permanent, removed with a tap of the screen to maximize the map view. No longer. I’d like to think that each iteration was designed to be more useful or helpful, but these features, and others, with increasing forcefulness instead guide the app user more quickly to the ranked paid-for lists of businesses vying for engagement. This app used to be great. Google maps is losing usefulness in a sea of frustrating and manipulative UX design.",0,
"So Google Maps has been my preferred driving directions app for years, but recently it hasn’t been working. The marker for my car (my location) updates extremely slowly, or sometimes doesn’t update at all, so I don’t get to see what the next turn is or what the map looks like in time for me to actually follow those directions. It’s quite frustrating. If this is a bug, I hope they get it fixed soon. I’ll also add that this is happening on streets and in areas where I’ve never had problems using Google Maps before. So, I don’t think it’s a cell service problem, unless Verizon’s cell service has suddenly, and dramatically worsened. This is also happening on an iPhone 6.",1,"Thank you for your review!

"This has been my go to map app since I got my iPhone but I am having to redownload Apple maps (which I honestly like much less) because this app has screwed me over too many times. It connects to the internet way too slowly (I know my phone isn’t the problem because no other apps have this problem, including Apple maps), and it will freeze in the middle of navigation so I have no idea where my next turn is and have to frantically close and re open the app, wait for it to connect to internet, and then replug in my phone. It’s dangerous and extremely frustrating. I’ll probably try it again in a few weeks in case an update fixes this problem but for now I just can’t use it like this.",0,
Been using Google maps for many years now and have always been very happy with it. I recently bought a new vehicle and the display screen is only compatible with Apple maps. I have since then been reminded of my hatred towards Apple maps. It’s actually hard to believe how horribly inaccurate it is. The directions that the app suggests are wrong most of the time. I’m shocked that a company like Apple would release such a pathetic product and allow it to continue to function so poorly. Moral of the rant is to stick with Google Maps.,0,
"I was a MotionX user until the free nav apps killed it off. Would have gladly paid twice what they were charging to keep it alive because it was so feature rich. Alas that was not to be so now I am using Google Maps which is great at picking the best routes but lacks even the most rudimentary feature such as showing speed limits! This data has been available on other gps systems for over 10 years. Giving your users just two simple things would probably earn you a ton of goodwill, give us speed limits and a warning feature when going over that speed limit a user select mph. Come on now, that shouldn’t be so difficult!",1,"Speed limits in navigation should be available in your country! Thank you for your patience as we roll this feature out.

Was looking for a good quality used car and happened upon Napelton infinity.  I wound up purchasing a beautiful used Lexus which was in exceptional condition as were all the used vehicles at this dealership.  Will Drake was my sales person and really went the extra mile to get me the best deal on my car. I could not have been more satisfied with their service and the quality of the used car that I purchased from this dealership.  I would recommend Napleton Infiniti to anyone who’s looking for a used vehicle and ask for Will Drake he really went the extra mile.,0,
"The app is usually my go to for directions, as I don’t like apple maps. I even use it to double check my car’s built in navigation sometimes. With a recent update though a feature has been removed that for a long time made my life much easier. Before as soon as you opened the app it would show you your places (home, work) and the travel times. I would check it every morning before going to work. It has been replaced with “explore” which just shows me local restaurants. Now to check traffic to work I need to put in the address and get directions. There’s no way to switch back to your places.",1,"Thanks for your review! Submitting this as a feedback report will help us ensure that this gets reviewed by the right team.

"1. If the app tells you with its voice over  direction of a route before the user begins his/her trip. Example; turn right on main St and and go .5 mi toward east and turn left on Lincoln ave. 2. If the app tells you the description of your lane. Example: “you are on second from right lane now, or you are on toll lane now and you should pay for it, or if tells you the cost of using toll at the time of usage. 3. If it tells you the speed limit updates by color codes, numbers. 4 after completing a trip if voice over ask you for saving the route or destination. 5. Before and after the trip if voice over tells your trip details. 5. If after the trip apps show how you get to your destination by providing a inter-built animation( which highway taken, which cities been driven through, the number of the road which have been taken, the number of city which you past through.",0,
"I loved this app for a long time.  But in the past month it has been very flaky.  It often tells me I have to go around the block to get to something right in front of me - no obstacles present.  It currently thinks I can’t take a left out of my neighborhood.  This is not only possible, the app knew this ever since I downloaded it.  It also has forgotten about a bridge which has been around for 50 years. No construction involved.  3 times this month it has told me one route was congested, but the other was clear.  When I started driving I found out it was the problem was the opposite of what the app told me and I was stuck on the wrong route.  I’ve been late to work twice and missed a cardiologist appointment.  I loved it when it was working but it’s useless now.",0,
"Hi google map team, you have done and continue to do a good job with the app, I live in a country that needs much updating to the map. I am a google guide and I would like to know when I can add and edit street name to the maps, especially around my home. Or is there another signup I can do to make these edits. Also can I drop a personal pin on a map and the give it a name that only will show on my map like home and work. Just some suggestions maybe it can be done and I haven't figured out how to yet.. but enjoy your week team and keep up the good work.",0,
"I have lived and breathed within Google Maps throughout my family travels across 17 countries and innumerable States. Years ago I found saving each significant memory location as a “⭐️ Starred place” was the best way to save our favorite family locations within my Google account. BEWARE, for reasons unknown, Google only allows a certain number (unknown # by the way) of “⭐️ Starred places” before it arbitrarily deletes the oldest saved locations?!?!  Per Google Maps I’ve never been to Paris although I had saved over 25 locations?!?!?  Can’t wait for my wife’s favorite restaurant in Madrid to disappear who-knows-when… So beyond irritating. 😠 So, Google Maps is best for directions, reviews and other “single-use” needs but not to live within… sorry to see you go Google. So sad.",0,
"Blast it all! Why did I update? The older version was simpler. This version reminds me of Apple Maps (blahhhhhh), because of all of the prompting and options it forces me to pick when I just want to see my directions as quickly as possible. This version requires me to hit more buttons to start my navigation. I used to be able to tap the bottom of the screen to get an overview of the directions. Now, a menu comes up and I have to tap “directions” and THEN a pop up comes up asking if I’d like to sync my music for the drive. That is TWO extra taps. Any extra taps are dangerous while driving. I always click “no” to syncing music but the prompt comes on every time. Simpler is better. Less is more.",0,
I’ve used google maps for years and it has always been very good until recently. Google has always had problems with routing you through unprotected left turns and crossing large unprotected intersections during traffic hours. However this problem has gotten more pronounced throughout time to the point where it is dangerous. To make things worse they have either removed or hid the feedback option so that I can no longer provide feedback about bad routes. This leads to other annoyances that I cannot provide feedback on - so here I am. Other issues: Telling me to turn left on no left turn streets. Routing me to completely wrong places once in a while. Please add the option to avoid unprotected left turns. Your algorithm is over tuned for the wrong thing. It’s dangerous.,0,
"Had chopped beef BBQ sandwich in savory sauce and side of French fries, although the awesome server recommended the tater tots. Wish I had opted for tater tots but lots of hot French fries. Had the combo which came with soft drink for iced tea. Then I overheard y’all about their homemade banana pudding. Got it to go but was so good I stayed and ate the whole thing which was piled high, Well worth the under the $10. large combo. Actually, the ladies room was decorated by a lady. Even had wicker love seat with cushion and being we’re going through freezing weather, the ladies room was so warm that I wanted to lay down on the love seat for the night. Well worth giving or a try.",0,
"I recently purchased a wedding band from Spexton Jewelry.  The Black Zirconium wedding band arrived today and I absolutely love it!  The customer service provided by Spexton is the best I've ever experienced while shopping online. I initially saw them on Pinterest. Placed a call to speak with them about their products, they returned all of my calls and when the ring was ready, I received A personalized video while they performed the final quality check before shipping the ring. The ring was wrapped very well for shipment And there was a thank you card enclosed.  Best customer service and great product! I am very pleased!",0,
"Several updates back Google removed the ability for the quick touch reveal of directional instructions. Now you have to click a couple of options before you can see the display of the written directions for your trip. This is problematic while driving. I like to be able to read ahead and find out what the next action will be before it happens.  The way it’s set up now I don’t find out what I’m going to do until I’m right in front of the turn. Also I would like to know how you can add detours while driving? If You live and I growing metropolitan area, roadwork is a daily annoyance. You may have a road blockage that was unplanned and need a way around.",0,
"The turn by turn directions have some really stupid features. Some notifications while you are driving are important, like faster route etc, but getting notifications mid-drive that say “slowdown ahead” as if I can’t already see on the map that it’s red up ahead are completely useless. Also, when you arrive at a destination, why doesn’t the map STAY ON THE SCREEN? It’s the most frustrating thing ever. “Walk the rest of the way there?” How about: I’m still in my car and couldn’t stop directly in front of the address so maps cancels the navigation...why. Just why. Keep the dang map on the screen please.",0,
"I have a simple map created from A start to stop that is 43 minutes away.  I favorited, and downloaded.  I go to open it and the “From” is gone only giving me the “To” for destinations.  I have researched online and all the way back to 2013 this is an ongoing issue.  If it’s truly creating a map with a range of options to get your where you need to be, then why is it so hard to navigate screens, favorite and download?  I’m trying to think logically about this because I like having the download option but it’s never  worked across any of my devices.  If there is a better way to do this I would love to have the resources to do this.",0,
"New update must be rolling out today, because I went to punch in an address for work and instead of showing me on a map, you know like Google MAPS should do, it automatically brings up “Directions: step one, turn left at...”  There is *literally* not even a mapping feature anymore on Google Maps.  Blows my mind that Google thought that someone navigating through an unfamiliar part of town would want to not want to see a virtual map of them driving, but only a list of steps to do to get to their destination. Hoping it’s just a glitch or bug but for now i’m not going to be bending over to read a small list of steps to do while i’m trying to drive.  Going back to Waze.  Google Maps was perfect before- why the heck would you change that?",0,
"When I had a Samsung Galaxy S6, the timeline feature worked very well. I relied heavily on it, in fact. Now, with my iPhone X, times of arrival and/or departure are nearly always wrong, and destinations are often completely omitted. This feature has become nearly useless for me. More than disappointing, this has caused me to have to go back to manually entering locations on my calendar. Too bad. I might just disable app activity for Maps because it doesn't do me any good anyway, since I use Waze to drive. The only thing I use Maps for anymore is finding a business and street view, but Apple Maps seems to have that pretty much taken care of, so I'm going to delete Google Maps and see if I can survive.",0,
I love google maps. It is so easy to use. It has never let me down. Only downside is that it uses data. Now that I have an unlimited plan I can get where I need to go anytime without worry of over using my allowance. It is so easy to find alternate routes. It saves my favorites. I can search by name if I don’t have the exact address. I can choose from contacts. It was especially nice showing speedtraps on freeways on my last couple of road trips. I like that you can download the guide for when you are in offline areas. I use it ALL the time!,0,
"I still prefer Google Maps over Apple Maps. However, Apple Maps just recently got upgraded, and it works flawlessly in CarPlay now. GOGLE MAPS NEEDS TO UPDATE THEIR CARPLAY APP TO KEEP UP WITH THE COMPETITION. Additionally, once I scrolled on the CarPlay app, the re-center button never appeared, forcing me to try and close out and reopen navigation all while driving. While most of my complaints revolve around CarPlay, I do also find the the app performance could be a little faster, and there are many inconsistent UI designs throughout the app. Lastly, what the heck is the for you tab? It really disappointed me. As well, my recommendation thing for restaurants never showed up and that was introduced over two years ago. And, they’ve begun introducing user input traffic condition, but it doesn’t seem to be fully functional...like shouldn’t it announce when there is a hazard ahead, like Waze. Anyway, I came mainly to complain about CarPlay but there a few other things that disappoint me to. It’s unfortunate because Google Maps still is the best mapping app in my opinion.",0,
"It has been one of my mostly-used apps. Ever.  I use if for navigation (obviously), but I also enjoy looking at the map and fancy where to go next. The reviews of various places by numerous people help tons. The only gripe I have is that it will give you the fastest route from Point A to Point B-without any regard to how narrow the streets are.  Here in Japan, there are tons of such streets and I’ve ended up scratching up my vehicle once.  If I see that it’s taking me to a narrow or an unreasonable route, I just stop and find another route. Overall though, it’s one of my top 3 favorite apps.",0,
"Love it because it has satellite option, multiple destination routing capability, and  voice recognition. Love it because it helps me route my daily work more efficiently. Hate it because it takes me on many wild goose chases thus wasting time, fuel, and efficiency. In the end I blame myself for not double checking with my street guide and personal knowledge. Hate it because it suggests I walk 2 hours rather than drive 10 minutes. Hate it because it routes me a 4 minute circuitous drive when my destination is actually 1 minute away. Hate it because the programmers think it's fun to install Where's Waldo or Super Mario onto your map. Hate it because the programmers think it's fun to have you see ""Welcome To Deer Ridge Dr, Round Rock, Texas"", even though your in KANSAS! Makes me question the sincerity of Google's dedication to having the best and most accurate mapping app. I'll keep using it because Apple maps (let alone I-phone) is not that great. I'll continue to double check every destination. I'll continue my search for a better app. Until then, thank you Google, for giving us a free headache app. It's the best out there, IMO (for what it is)",0,
"When I first set this app up for a trip, I pick a route I want.  It is not the fastest route. I don't want the fastest route. I get started on my trip and many times I get pop ups telling me there is a faster route. I picked the route I want in the beginning.  I also don't want to keep changing routes in the middle of driving. It will ask me twice or even three times. It even changed my route automatically.  When I make a wrong turn or even stop at a gas station that's on my route I picked it will try to change my route. I had to switch to the stock IOS navigation app, which I'm assuming knows and understands which route I want and picked in the beginning.  I do not recommend this app on long trips.  Even the arrival destination time is different than IOS on the same route.",0,
"Terrible working with offline maps.  Sometimes the three bars on left of search bar appears (which is how one is supposed to get to offline maps) and sometimes it does not as a different interface appears saying “Search for a location” Why? Why is the interface not consistent.  Furthermore after saving offline maps, retrieving them is almost impossible- it takes a rocket scientist to figure it out. Why cannot it be intuitive. And finally after retrieving the offline maps clicking on them does nothing. It is like a saved PICTURE of the map area you saved without being able to use it to actually give directions. Extremely frustrating experience with Google not to mention hours of time wasted.",0,
"On my iphone 7+, Google Maps seems to slowly be getting slower. It takes six or so seconds to launch each first time, which i could bear easily, but then often for four or five minutes it will send me one way, lets say a right turn, and then change its mind in thirty seconds, and tell me to u-turn. I was going to delete and try re-installing, but then noticed my apple watch 4 has no Google Maps support. Forget it then. I’ll just delete it and move on. Three stars because of the ability to create multiple stops are there, even though badly implemented.  Otherwise its closer to a two star spyware app, as far as I’m concerned.",0,
"This navigation app, though classic, works x1000 times better than Apple Maps. Apple Maps looks like it was invented by a child in comparison to this one. Also, totalitarian that it is, Apple doesn't allow reviews on its app, ao that they can continue giving you the same terrible experience. They know that all they need to sell something is their name--doesn't matter if it works well or even works at all. Thank you Google, for providing an alternative that's better than any other. Google Maps is the best!",0,
The auto route change has got me into a couple of bad situations. Before my trips I select the exact route I want to use. Then mid trip if I’m paying attention to the road and not my phone the app will change the route by itself. A couple of times now the app has auto changed the route sending me into areas that weren’t safe. Areas that would have been avoided if I were still on the route I chose. My advice is that instead of automatically changing the route if we don’t press the button. Leave the route alone. If we don’t press any buttons the route should stay on the route we selected. This blundered quark in this app ruins it for me. I have to sit there and worry if the route is going to change. Which makes me a distracted driver. Change this function,0,
"Up until the last update, when you searched for the location, the location beacon would remain in place when you closed the statistical data to the left of the screen.  Now when you close that data screen, which cannot be reopened without putting in the location again (why not?!  Side irritation.), the beacon disappears!!!  So the only way you can look at the area around the beacon is if you leave the statistical data screen up...WHICH TAKES UP HALF OF THE SCREEN.  This is extremely frustrating and annoying...please, please, please, fix this ASAP.  Then I’ll change my 3 stars :^( to 5 stars!  :^)  Thank you for listening.",0,
"I’ve had google maps for years on my iPhone 6. It’s been my go to and has always worked flawlessly but I never updated it! iPhone 6 died so I got an 8, I updated everything. Google maps and transit was absolutely horrible. I have a brain. I don’t need to know if there’s a coffee shop near by. I just don’t care. And the worst part about it is you can’t turn it off. Luckily I decided to get an iPhone 11 and I took my 8 back. Restored from iTunes (with all of my old non-updated apps from my 6) and my old version of google maps! Don’t care if it doesn’t take up the whole screen I’m using the old version. Only reason for not giving one star is the fact that it’s been so good for many years.",0,
"Surprised to see a new icon. I will have to get used to it. It’s not bad and it’s more lively, IMO. I haven't used the app since the new icon, so I can’t comment on whether or not I have had any problems using it. Some people are complaining that the app looks bad or that the app is bloated. But there are settings deep within the app that you could possibly change to make it a bit simpler. I don’t know if Google will respond to the comments by putting the app back the way it looked. But I hope that whatever happens it will work out for everyone. Thanks.",0,
"I appreciated the prompt response from the developer and the quick repair. The issue listed below no longer appears to be an issue. I would have provided a 5 star rating, however, there are times when the traffic information is not as up to date as the current scenario. It is still one of my top two apps for navigating heavy and quickly changing urban/city traffic. I would recommend it to a friend. The traffic layer must be reapplied upon opening the app after recent update. There's no way to make the traffic layer a permanent layer option. Do not update.",1,"Thank you for letting us know about this issue, and your patience as we fixed the problem. We appreciate it! With the latest update, Google Maps should now be working as usual."
"Love it but the last few updates have glitches. Now every time I try to look at the reviews, leave a review, or just look at the information about someplace it always just closes the app. If google fixes this problem it will be great but right now it is bothering me. As far as the maps, it is great and definitely superior to iOS maps. It would be wise on their end though to start trying to compete with Waze. I have not used it personally but know many people that do. Waze seems to have better sensitivity to a faster route and provide better alerts such as when there is a vehicle on the shoulder ahead.",0,
"Google Maps used to be the gold standard, such that I wouldn’t go near Apple Maps even when it began to improve. However, the quality of the navigation has deteriorated significantly recently. I’ve seen it consistently announce turns late, prematurely, or not at all; continuously adjust my location; and not provide timely lane guidance. In addition, the traffic information is often unreliable — it often shows traffic jams that have long since cleared up, and I’ve found that Apple Maps is more reliable at displaying short-term road closures. I still have trust problems with Apple Maps, but Google is forcing my hand because I cannot use an app that causes me to miss turns due to poor timing of announcements.",0,
"Google, just like other apps for directions will by-pass my destination or tell me “You are not on a road!!” It frequently by-passes my destination and have me make a U-turn at the next cross street. When I arrived at my destination , I discovered I passed 2 streets with traffic lights that would have taken me to my designation faster and without making a U-turn at one of the busiest roads in town! I am so frustrated with all the direction apps. And talking about the shortest distance, one of my apps takes me on a scenic drive to get me to my destination! Thanks for letting me vent. I will continue to use Google because it’s the most accurate of all the apps!",0,
At the risk of being killed in a car accident I’m on installing this stupid app because Google can’t decide or make up their minds on the layout or a user experience I can’t even find the home button on how to change from walking to driving directions anymore as far as I can tell you have to click 15 times after you’ve already gotten directions to click out of the map redo your directions and then go back to it,0,
"Google Maps use to be my one and only trusted map app. I loved it because Google did a terrific job of mapping cities and business which also made for an excellent space to read reviews and discover new/interesting routes, shops, landmarks and restaurants. Up until about 2 years ago, the app seemed fine. I thought it occasionally provided poor instructions because NYC has many inter-connecting streets and its highways layer over each other in several places in Brooklyn where I lived for 8 years. But recently during my drive back to Detroit, I can’t count the number of times the app has given poor geolocation read-outs. It barely knows where my car is located on the road and the directions have become severely delayed. I’ve updated the app multiple times and have not seen a single issue repaired. I now use Waze and have also resorted to using Apple Maps again (which has evolved in major ways). Google Maps is still great for looking up shops, services &amp; restaurants but that’s really about it. It’s basically a digital Yellow Pages now. Fix this App please.",0,
"Ive used google maps for the last 5 years or so and within the last year and a half the app has been incredibly unreliable. I have had this issue across different phones and different providers. I have talked to many other individuals who have issues with the app as well. It frequently is not able to pinpoint where I am (thinks Im .5 miles in a different direction), the app crashes, or takes me a totally ridiculous route. I just completed a trip that should take four hours. The ETA using google was an additional HOUR later than the ETA when I plugged the same address in using Waze. Waze combats traffic much more effectively than Google. Would recommend Waze over Google until Google can step up its game. Pretty disappointing.",0,
"Just completed a 14 day trip around Iceland. For the most part, google map was better than any other application out there. The maps were reliable about 90% of the trip but I wouldn’t mind if it did better in the re-routing department. Several times, I could see a shorter route from the advantage of elevation but google map struggled to figure out what I was doing and would end up just stopping navigation all together. Overall though, it seems to have the most updated reviews for sightseeing and eating. Also very handy when looking for gas stations in remote areas.",0,
"I cannot STAND Google Maps any longer since I now have to deal with the STUPID ANNOYING ""Explore Nearby"" pop up blocking the screen when opening the app!!!! This is not a social app for me nor do I use social apps!!!! Does Google understand we are not in some other city or unknown area vacationing where I need their explore tab??? I know my own neighborhood!!! We used to have an extremely nice simple clean UI with your ""Home"" and ""Work"" quick tap icons which I used daily (to check traffic prior to leaving) now I have to dig thru the hamburger menu just to find those taps!!!! This app is getting more and more bloated and cluttered!! I now use INRIX for traffic and Apple Maps for directions, something I never thought I'd use but it's so much better now and getting better with iOS 13!!!",0,
"Love the app! Use it on a daily basis. But have couple complaints/wish list of things that could help. I am a semi truck driver and wish that you could have the ability to select truck routes only. That would be amazing help keep me out of tight spots. The other thing I would love to see is drag and click directions, some times I get a  Preapproved route from state and wish I could either drag lines to match or be able to type it in so I don’t have to keep looking at the oversize permits every time I need a reminder on the route.  Thanks!",0,
"I typically don’t use a whole lot of maps as I don’t go out very much but when I do Google is usually my choice and I like them because of their pictures the quality of the pictures and how easy it is to understand what they’re telling you if you want something simple I would probably stick with Google other apps like while Waze and maybe one that comes on your phone may still be good quality however Google seems to be on top of it, as for myself anyway 😉",0,
"Whenever I travel, this app saves me from death several times, whether from starving to death, dying of exposure, or dying of boredom. I really love that you can see the current gas prices in the app, and that you can explore the food around you. It's also gotten really good at navigating to specific places within buildings—for example, malls, previously danger zones, have now become safer. Though sometimes it may have a skewed sense of where sidewalks are, if you just follow the destination bubble point thing you will reach it eventually.",0,
"I use this app literally everyday, multiple times throughout the day. The train, subway, and walking transit options were amazing when I traveled to Switzerland. While it does has its hangups and strange routes from time-to-time, the good definitely outweighs any negatives. Please update to display the speed limit like Apple maps does. Also, being able to report a wrong direction given through voice directions would be helpful also. I’ve encountered oftentimes when I need to turn right but voice directions say left.",1,"Speed limits in navigation should be available in your country! Thank you for your patience as we roll this feature out. To use this feature (once it’s available to you) in the latest version of Google Maps just start driving navigation.

"Before the update Google Maps (as gps) would from time to time mess up. After the update Google Maps (as gps) barely functions. -To begin, each and every time I start my car and/or open the app I have to re-pair it with Bluetooth. Every. Time. -Then, after entering my info in and press “Start” gps will speak 5-6 words and stop, it’s done. No amount of coaxing, restarting the app or my phone, even restarting my car will get the f’ng thing to work. This is particularly disturbing being a female in an unfamiliar place at night that isn’t safe...which means that I drive aimlessly until some landmark is familiar and can then figure out how to get back to the expressway. -Or, for some unknown reason the thing takes on a black background instead of the satellite background and not only refuses to function as gps but also refuses to leave the black screen. -If, for some miracle it’s working, it’ll tell me, for example, “your destination is on the left”, when in fact I passed my destination a block ago! -Without exaggeration, Google Maps works as gps possibly 12% of the time making it a complete fail to me....and btw, my ios is up to date.",0,
"I love Google Maps! I appreciate how it will route me around a wreck on the interstate saving me time and the frustration of sitting in traffic. I appreciate that it has the speed limit on the screen so I can easily gage my speed. I also like that I can preview my route, something Apple Maps doesn’t let you do for some reason. The only way I believe this app could be better is if you listed the Town and state. So many time people will ask me, “where are you?” And all I can tell them is the road number. Another GREAT Google product!",0,
"Google maps used to be the best app out there. However I use it everyday for work and I have found in the past three months it has gone vastly downhill to the point where I am switching. It’s things like not realizing planed exit closures, inaccurate eta, and when driving on the highway keeps accidentally putting me on the road parallel. This never was a problem till about late August for some reason. Today was the last straw when it told me to turn left drive around the next neighborhood then pass my house again going the other direction. Hopefully they fix these problems eventually but for now it is not worth it",0,

"It had become slow in response to wrong turn. Not only so but several times now, it would constantly switch routes on me back and forth in a span of a few seconds, as if glitching. It used to be great at detecting location when pulled up by other apps such as Instagram and yelp. Now, when I click on a location through the geo-tag on Instagram and select “open in google map” it would just do a general search for the name of the place in the search bar rather than going directly to the exact location like it used to. This makes it very difficult when pulling up location in other city/state because it would always error out saying location doesn’t exist or give the wrong location.",0,
I love google maps the best navigation you can get.. one thing that would really push this maps over the edge for me is if some they could add weather or a radar to sea weather in real time because I travel 2000 miles a month and being able to see wether on my other app that shows the me the weather and my location helps...  I like to drive to see what I’m coming up to helps me better prepare for for the upcoming area so I know how heavy the rain is and if I need to be more safe.... please google maps that would be amazing...,0,
"Don’t listen to most of the negative reviews here. Those are from people who rely far too much on GPS for info they should be getting from road signs. Apple Maps tried to take me the wrong way down an exit ramp (that was a fun little mix of anxiety, confusion, and frustration). While Apple Maps has iOS integration (“Hey Siri, take me to...”, tapping an address in contacts, etc), Google Maps has been around a lot longer and is years ahead of Apple in navigation. Does Apple have self-driving cars that rely on its nav system? Didn’t think so.",0,
"Awful. Can't keep up with your vehicle-also, it gets very confused whenever there are more than two roads running along beside each other. If you're interested in a GPS application that will continually tell you that you're on the service road while you're sailing down interstate at 75 mph, this is what you're looking for. Also, don't think about getting off the road to get a cheeseburger-there's no way to get Google maps to shut up for five minutes while you get some food-it will continually tell you where to go what to do and how to get there while you're in the drive-through. All you can do is shut it down, and then reenter your destination in the tragically arcane interface that was obviously built by engineers instead of people who know how to design a UI.",0,
"UPDATE: This feature has been restored! Thanks to the dev team for listening and taking action. Original Review: I used to be able to drop a pin anywhere, and if Street View was available it would show me the image. If I pressed the image, it would take me to Street View. Now I must know the exact address of where I would have dropped the pin in order for Street View to work. This is a change for the worse, especially for people traveling to unfamiliar places that want to have some idea of what to expect.",1,"Thank you for letting us know about this issue, and your patience as we fixed the problem. We appreciate it! Google Maps should now be working as usual."
"Even if you have used your account to login, it cannot synchronize the setting of your account in the other phone. I just got a new phone and login in the app using my original account; but I forgot to change “avoid toll” which was the setting in my original phone, then the Google pointed out a way which finally costed me around 10. The difference between each version is sometimes big. I use the app when I am driving and sometimes I need to change something in the app; but it is hard for me to change since the method to change that setting is changed in the new version; this is really distractive while you are driving. Also the google still cannot fix the bug when you move to and depart from the carpool lanes.",0,
"I have forever loved google maps and how updated the maps are in big cities. However, there is a change I would like to see. In Bing Maps, it allows you to drag your route to any alternate highway/road you come up with when setting a destination. This feature can be accomplished by making so that you can press, hold, and drag the blue route to any highway. Also, I have sent repeatedly time and time again feedback about how satellite imagery has not been upgraded in my home area of Quincy, IL since 2009.",0,
"I’ve always preferred Google Maps vs my IOS maps, however two updates ago the satellite map I use as a GPS to navigate around Las Vegas got very dark. So dark in some sections of town that I can’t even utilize the map because I can’t see anything. (Referring to the satellite views utilized during GPS navigating.) I hope they fix it because I can’t use the app with it like this. (I’ve sent in screenshots and feedback however this newest update has not corrected the issue, maybe one day they’ll fix it.) I also like the reviews on google maps and the Waldo game last winter was a fun surprise.",0,
"Google maps used to be simple &amp; straightforward &amp; easy to use. It did have a bunch of silly errors in the Washington DC map, but it was still useful. Now they've added all sorts of junk, allegedly to give you a more personalized experience. As in creepy Big Brother Google seems to want to know even more about you than he did before. But beyond the privacy concerns, BBG has put so much extra sign in, search nearby, get tips, etc., etc. that it's a real hassle to just look up where something is on a map. There are times when I could pull out a hard copy atlas and find a place faster than by using this app. By trying to do everything in this one app, Google has made it lousy at doing the most important thing I want from it: be a map.",0,
"My best friend and I were in Chicago this weekend. When trying to use google maps for directions not a single time did it go as it should have. It was frustrating enough when it would calculate our position on the wrong road but it was down right dangerous and terrifying when we were directed to turn the wrong direction on one way streets!!  This happened not once, not twice, but well over a dozen times...this app was trying to kill us!!  Yes, I make that comment in jest because I know that wasn’t the intention but it was scary enough to feel that way. I will not ever use this app again and I warn others to either use this app with extreme caution or do not use it at all as I plan to. I am giving the app one star but I wouldn’t give it that if I had the option of zero!!",0,
I emailed for a quote with make and model of my new car and what my expectations were for darkness and UV/IR blockage. The responded promptly and with multiple options to fit any budget along with details on each option. All employees are courteous and professional and their work is immaculate!!  I could not be happier with both their service and the installation. Appointment was made promptly and completed as agreed. I’ve waited more than a week after install to be sure no bubbles or defects manifested and am happy to report work is impeccable. Could not recommend them more highly.,0,
Add features like road ratings collect bump data for roads! That can help the government fix roads or improve traffic show traffic data history. Statistics would help a lot of development! Also add user protection features similar to Waze like but make them different like avoid bump or bumpy road avoid crash prone areas avoid speeding here etc etc Google street view is also affecting property value without dated street view pictures form 2011 when it’s about to be 2020 please update especially in Orlando thanks very much!,0,
Love the app use it all the time for work as I have lots of places to go and travel is awesome I do wish it would tell you peak traffic (when it’s busy) when I linking routes for instance if I go from Tulsa Oklahoma to Florida I wish it would say something like big delay Atlanta 5 pm traffic you know like let you know the usual wait everyday then you could detour or whatever you need to do to have a smooth trip other tha. That it is awesome gets me exactly where I need to be every time absolutely love GOOGLE and al their Services especially maps!!!,0,
"I have used Google maps for years and it has always been spot on. With this last update I have found it to be extremely unreliable. At first I was thinking it just a fluke that Google maps was not announcing turns and exits or would let me drive right by my destination. Then 2 nights ago it routed me right into a traffic jam and even had the little “accident” marker on my route. When I managed to take the next turn I noticed the blue marker had not moved. Tonight I set it to route me home but watched carefully only to find that the cursor would be as much as 4 miles off. Not Good!!!! Google, what happened? Are you lost? I used to know a good app that could help you find your way without fail.........",1,"3/21/18 Did this resolve your concerns? 2/23/18 Thank you for letting us know about this issue, and your patience as we fixed the problem. We appreciate it! Google Maps should now be working as usual."
"for many years I have relied on Google maps to get me where I need to go everywhere. For some reason the last two weekends when I made longer trips, it gets lost and confused. Last weekend it got me lost in Grand Rapids Michigan, this weekend it got me lost in Ann Arbor Michigan. Even coming home from Ann Arbor, it instructed me to take an exit to a different freeway which I know was wrong. When traveling to Ann Arbor while I was on the freeway instructed me to make a turn on the street that didn’t exist. I normally would give you 4-5 stars but something is going wrong. After getting off of the freeway I looked at my screen and it was clear that it had no idea where I was, it still showed my status on the freeway many miles back.",0,
"I’ve used Google maps almost daily for work and travel ever since Google released the app. It was flawless and great. Just recently however it has been glitching beyond use. I’ve tried everything I could to fix it but no luck. Randomly and without warning my location has not been accurate AT ALL. Sometimes my location will stay at the beginning of the trip even though I’m driving, other times I’ll be using it fine and my location will jump to the middle of no where. Basically making the app worthless and unreliable in times of need. Don’t know if others are having the same issue but I will be switching apps until this is fixed.",0,
"While Google maps is the best navigation I have found for iPhone, it has one flaw that drives me absolutely up the wall. When I was a kid and learn how to read a map, I learned that north is always at the top of the map. Google maps actually used to do this but in the latest upgrades it has started to spin around like a top. I would prefer that my pointer do the spinning in my map remain stationary. When I’m trying to find something on there, I want north to be north. I would appreciate it if you would give us the option of setting this in settings so that people who like it the way it is can also have their preference. Thank you",0,
"I have used this app for many years and very much enjoyed it until recently. These days, it’ll recommend a route through the most difficult traffic just to save me three minutes, so I select a more calm route. Five minutes into the drive, it informs me that it’s re-routing me through the route I intentionally avoided because it will save me 3 minutes. Worst of all, it says this re-route will take place unless I unlock my phone and select “no thanks” within a time limit. All while driving! This is going to get someone killed. At the very least, reverse the roles and make me select “yes please” if I want to be re-routed, because it is very frustrating to have my choice overruled by default unless I take action.",0,
"There’s a bug where the app does not give spoken directions that has been going on for weeks and has not been fixed. I have checked my phone volume and unmuted the app. The spoken directions work only when I am playing music when it pauses the music and interrupts with directions. As soon as I turn off the music, the spoken directions stop so this is clearly a bug. The information the app provides about which lanes to use is almost always incorrect. I live in Los Angeles so I would expect Google to have up to date information about roads that have not been changed in years but they do not. I have also been put on private roads many times. Guess it’s time to go back to Apple maps.",1,"Hi there. Thanks for your review! We've listed a few steps to try to fix voice navigation problems in this Help Center article: https://goo.gl/wE6p1e.

"Thought I’d try this place out because my friend suggested it and it’s awesome. The atmosphere is comfortable and the tenders aren’t pushy. In fact, Merrick, the tender who helped me, actually was patient and very informative. It was nice to not feel rushed to make a choice and actually get to look at each product. Also, get all your questions answered. I will definitely be using this shop as my smoke shop. They, also, have a large variety of items. That’s why I like it so much. I learned about so many more options to smoke.",0,
"Hi, google maps tech people, I don’t want to see a picture-list I just want a name-list of places I’m searching. Like when I search “food” and you put big pictures of a burger and the name of the place is below the scroll line? Nah, change it back. I can see more names with less scrolling than pictures of things. Which helps when I’m looking for food places while I’m driving (yes, while driving; who isn’t looking at their google maps while driving). Anyways can you go back to that default or give me an option for that setting? Also if you’re going to change anything in the future, why would not give us the option to keep the old setting? Sometimes the new things you all come up with are not better nor wanted. No offense.",0,
"The latest update adds the ability to access the Google Assistant right from the maps navigation screen. When navigating you'll see a button in the top portion of the screen, click it and you can ask many many things, but even useful things like: what is my current ETA, or when is my next turn - very useful when you can't read the screen easily. Hopefully Google maps will next add the Ok Google functionality so we won't have to press the new button.",0,
Went in to have service inspection on my front driver seat and service guy Camden Blake was very unprofessional and rude to me because I was African American! He even damaged my gas cap cover on my Mercedes when I reached out to the service manager he pointed the finger at me and blamed me for his employee damaging my vehicle. I would like to be fully refunded on the service because of Camden damaging my gas top cover I was stranded in an unsafe area where I ran out of gas and could not do anything until the service guy arrived an hour later to help me. I was also setting in my vehicle for 2 hours waiting which caused me to lose hours of sleep before having to work the night shift at my job. I am completely upset about this experience and have reached out to corporate to have this matter further disputed.,0,
"Under a layer of abstraction? I must have missed when the last update happened, but the app no longer launches with the traffic layer already shown. You have to either select it w/ two menu taps or start a navigation in its current version; 4.36.7.  This makes the app super unfortunate to use now. Would you pretty please at least make it an option to launch w/ traffic shown? Update: the traffic layer is default on upon open again! This is once again my go to map app. Thanks guys.",1,"Thank you for letting us know about this issue, and your patience as we fixed the problem. We appreciate it! With the latest update, Google Maps should now be working as usual."
"Three different times I traveled the same road assuming the road was actually open because the map showed no closure. Each time I had to follow detour signs to find my way. I don’t understand why google maps didn’t know (and still doesn’t know about the detour). Also, a recent update eliminated the ability for the map to stay on the phone screen as a banner at the top (like a phone call). If I am using the map (which I do a lot) and have to go to a different screen it is now a pain to navigate back to the map. I really need this functionality back.",0,

So I’m driving a stick shift trying g to follow the gps map and the I phone x is so slippery from it being new and coated with nanoglass or whatever it’s a battle trying to keep it still from sliding around my whole car. It’s in the backseat? No problem a brake stab and now it’s under my accelerator. U have to hold it to use the gps feature and then yelp keeps popping up wanting me to install it so that I can continue using the new google gps food review holding my phone and gps hostage while I constantly close out of the small pop ups and trying to navigate through all the twisted answered touchscreen questions while driving missing my turns and Uturning through pedestrians so I can see google gps. I can hear it but I’m not accustom to following instructions verbally.,0,
"Being an iPhone user there are certain instances where using “Maps” is my only option if I want it right then and there. Every time this happens I realize just how much better Google Maps is not only to that particular navigational app, but any that dare to compete for downloads. There is Google Maps, and then there are all of the others. It’s just not even close. At least they have something going in their favor. Because there is the iPhone, and then there is everyone else.",0,
"It is nice to see some improvements to the app such as crowd reports. However, the app has more frequently sent me on a round about way at the last minute. I would add a picture if I could. The app initially gave me a direct route from the freeway to a location a block off on the right. At the last minute it changed it to taking a left under the freeway and going around a number of lights to make a big circle to get to a place I could see on my right at the intersection. Unfortunately, once committed to the left, this intersection did not allow a turn to the right. How about concentrating efforts on correct directions instead of bells and whistles. Update. Now the voice is so low I can barely hear it. I used to love this app.",0,
"At some point, the option to set departure/arrival time was removed. I use this to plan when to leave to avoid traffic some time in the future. It does show a histogram of travel times +/- a couple hours from the current time, but that’s usually not what I need if I’m planning a trip. If I need to know how to get somewhere now, chances are it doesn’t matter how long it will take me to get there. If I’m planning a trip a day or several hours out, however, I probably have freedom to adjust. The web version of maps lets you chose departure/arrival, but it doesn’t show the histogram, so you can’t see when traffic might be better without trial-and-error changing of departure time.",0,
"Let me be straightforward: This app is always biased on toll road in navigation. What’s worse, it just doesn’t let you know there are available toll-free routes  with similar ETAs if you don’t check ‘avoid tolls’’. For two times navigating from Manhattan to New Haven, google map wanted to direct me passing RFK bridge, a $6 tolled bridge. I just insisted not taking that Exit 17 ramp, then a free I-278 to I-95 would show. I live near NYC where lots bridges and roads have tolls. Recently I made some careful comparison between google map and Apple’s built-in map navigation, and finally came to this horrifying conclusion. From New Haven to somewhere East 100 st Manhattan, in an evening with light traffic, Apple map gives these options: 1. Via I-95, fastest, 1 hr 22 min, with tolls; 2. Via CT-15, 1 hr 29 min, free. Google map? 3 options, ALL with tolls!! Fastest one 1 hr 22 min, then 10 min slower one, and 23 min slower one. Where the hell is that toll-free route!! If you want to blame me for not checking ‘avoid tolls’ in google map by myself, I strongly disagree with this idea. Even if I don’t check that, does this mean I want to pay AVOIDABLE tolls? Why don’t google map even show that toll-free option??",0,
"While the app is great for judging current traffic conditions, the app has some sort of bug that doesn’t allow me to set up my home or work address so I have to always type in my addresses when the built-in functionality is supposed to allow you to setup your frequent destinations (I.e home).... Additionally, when selecting other features within the app, it appears the selection is loading before erroring out and defaulting me to the previous screen. While I enjoy using the app for judging current conditions, I hate having to type in the SAME addresses and not take advantage of the functionality of the app.",0,

Nooo! Why are you guys trying to fix something that isn’t broken? There are sooo many bugs on this app that I don’t know what on earth it was trying to fix or add. My google maps is lagging. I would pass the street and google maps doesn’t announce anything. Just the whole lot of it isn’t working. I can’t even explain every part of it that’s no longer working properly. It finds the correct destination BUT doesn’t get me there. I’ve tried so many different ways to work with it. Down to getting a screen shot of the directions to follow. Please fix this Apple. I depend on this app for work. It was such a great tool. I’m so disappointed.,0,
"Before the previous update my Google Maps ran perfectly. Then the update came and I thought “OK. Improvements on something that that works perfectly fine. Maybe it could be better. After all, we could all use improvements in our lives.” Well, I was wrong!!! I travel a lot and the updates are a pain in the *#%! It shows that I am in the middle of somewhere I am not. It takes forever to figure out where I am at. Comes up in a language I don’t speak. And is late giving me real time info. Seriously, I really need to stick to “If it ain’t broke....” But that red marker on my apps tab was getting on my nerves. I am going to reign in my OCD and ignore the new updates *%#¥ from now on.",0,
"If geocoordinates are entered as the destination, make certain you follow every turn the app directs you to make. If you miss a turn and it recomputes your route, it will shift your destination and start to direct you to the wrong place. Sometimes miles away from your intended destination. Additionally the app lacks the ability to get addresses from your contact database.  This seems like a basic must have to me, that I was shocked is missing, or buried so far that in three weeks of looking, I still haven't found it. This apps turn by turn navigation is very good.  Recomputes if you miss a turn or know a different way for part of your journey, or just see something down a side road  you want to check out. Some of the functionality isn't immediately obvious, and I have had to retype in addresses because I backed up the wrong way once or twice looking to find a way to pick a different route.  Eventually I found the correct button to push. Add the ability to map to an address in my iPhone's contact database, and this will be my regular maps app. User beware!!!",0,
"I use Google Maps all the time. I love that I can set up a route on my computer and text it to my phone to use in the app. We use this all the time when going on outings with our car club. Driving vintage British cars, there’s two things I’d love to see added. I’d love an option to turn on a digital clock and speedometer at the top of the screen in day 1/4” tall numbers. Our old cars don’t have clocks and the speedos aren’t very accurate. This feature would give us both items easily when we glance at our map.",0,
The map used to display on my phone which is in a holder placed where I can quickly glance at it without taking my eyes away from the road. Now my phone displays a list of written directions while the map is on my car’s computer screen. Which is located down too low to be glancing at frequently in heavy traffic. I’ve nearly rear ended people several times since this change. Some users may like this update. I hate it and will be giving Waze a try. Google Maps needs to give users a settings option to choose how to display the map/directions. I prefer the old way; map on my phone screen with the current written direction at the top of the screen. No list of written directions at all.,0,
This is a wonderful place to get sober with great professional counselors along with organic food.

"Google Maps is mostly excellent, but a couple of its flaws seriously degrade its usefulness. Recently, it’s started suggesting a new route while you’re driving to help avoid traffic or other issues, and it says something like, “If you don’t want to take the new route, press ‘no’”. To do this, I would have to pick up and unlock my phone  before I could even be at the screen to look at it to choose an option. I understand the need to have an option for choosing to take an alternate route. How about “shake the phone if you want to take the alternate route”? Or allow microphone permission and have us say “yes” if we want to take the route? Also, the notifications of upcoming turns or merges need to be a little sooner to allow for time to merge through lanes of busy traffic without having to push through like a jerk. Again, the app does a good job overall of getting you where you need to be; it just needs a few things tweaked to minimize user swearing.",1,"Thanks for the review.

Do you plan to support Dark Mode? All areas that are white should be reversed and made black and vis versa. My girlfriend recently used Google Maps to find an address in Long Island City. The directions given were a very long way having her cross over train tracks and walk by strip clubs where people around there thought she must have worked there. I would think that Google Maps would give you safe directions. Once to her location she asked for a safer rout and they were able to give here much safer directions to get back. Please do a better job at directions... This should never have happened in the first place.,0,
"Found out that a route I chose on the map was changed twice without letting me know. It was a 5-hour drive, so while going down the highway looking at the road, the screen said rerouting for less than a second without an audio warning about it. I didn’t catch this until the second time it did it. It ended up taking me on a route way off from the way I wanted to go, so my 5-hour drive had ended up in another side of a mountain range extremely far from the interstate I had been trying to get on. This GPS kept making me avoid the road I wanted to get on and screwed me over. Summary: The GPS gave me two routes to choose from. I chose the one I wanted, and it ended up choosing the other after 2 minutes starting without my permission.",0,
"This has been my go-to guidance app for years. Always rated it a 5. Recently, the “start directions” button is now followed by “start gps” before it will navigate, for some reason. It has introduced slower processing speed, particularly in urban areas. So much slower in quick turns with tall buildings around that it lags and I miss the turn. Noted same issue another reviewer complained about. The “heads up” has also gotten quirky and the arrow representing my auto is often turned 90 degrees/sideways. Confusing. I’m going to try something else. Would love to hear from the developer in what’s up with this gps addition.",0,
"Normally I love google maps and even deleted the Apple maps app from my phone but recently had to download it again because my google maps app hasn’t worked. It won’t have my location or direction of travel correct (saying I’m on a different street and/or traveling in the opposite direction of what I’m truly traveling). And because it hasn’t had my location and direction correct, the navigation will not update and/or it’ll continue to tell me to turn around. What’s the deal? I have the latest version downloaded, I’ve deleted the app and re-downloaded it and have powered my phone off and back on hoping one of these would fix the issue but it hasn’t.

"Consistently will just stop giving auditory directions for no reason. It’ll tell you two turns in a row and then just leave out the next three. Doesn’t track well either. If you’re driving on a highway with a service road it’s not uncommon for it to think you are on the service road and not the highway, and often times it will just completely lag in tracking your position.  A bad app with bad technology, but it’s google so you already know they’ve stacked their review scores with paid reviews. This app isn’t going anywhere anytime soon and it’s reviews are going to stay favorable regardless of the app’s poor performance.

"If you’re looking for a cute little novelty app to find a movie or comedy, Google maps is for you. If you want a real GPS, use TomTom, Here Maps, or Garmin. Unfortunately not everyone is a city dweller who never leaves the confines of their community. Google is useless to the serious traveler who needs an app that doesn’t burn through the data and doesn’t require a constant cell signal. Anyone who travels this country knows that mobile service is very spotty or nonexistent in many parts of the country, leaving Google maps at the wayside and useless. Sorry Google, until you can come up with downloadable maps that can be used off-line like your competitors, you’ll never really be a true contender.

"Only one star because I use this app everyday as a medical transportation driver, when I drive on the road I see a lot of people using Google Maps so why doesn’t google make the effort to add speedometer on the screen and which they wouldn’t pay more attention to the address editing because at the same time Google Maps is good it could also be bad if the area is not popular but I believe with the help of every day drivers Uber driver or ppl that need navigation to get somewhere 90% of people use good maps so I think good should care more about their users",0,
"I love Google Maps but with one of the recent updates my saved locations (Home and Work) either don’t come up or I have to search to find them.

Sure the recent searches is nice but saved locations are saved for a reason. Keep them where they can easily be found please! It’s dangerous to have to search and takes more time.",1,"Thank you for letting us know about this issue, and your patience as we fixed the problem. We appreciate it!

"There should be an option that once you put in your destination that allows you to make the choice of whether to avoid tolls and to avoid highway's... and not within the phone...once you click on the app you should be allowed to once you put in your destination before you hit start there should be an option somewhere that you can say avoid tolls avoid highways....this is one of the reasons I use scout, because once I put in my directions and before I hit start to give me those directions right within the app in the upper right corner it allows me too make that choice if I want to, which is avoid tolls or highways",1,"1/19/18 Did this resolve your concerns? 12/7/17 Thanks for your review!

"Funny how Google Maps are not accurate, I have had my address wrong on their maps forever and have tried contacting them because of it. My mail and packages are always getting delivered to the wrong address. The reason... well because they show my house on the wrong block.  Same street name and house numbers but I live on WEST and if you type my address to locate it it will show that my house is located EAST at someone else’s house. Please correct this inconvenience to me. I’m tired of guessing where my mail might end up. And if the honest person that lives in that house now moves and a dishonest person moves into that house there’s no way I can prove that they got my mail and they could keep whatever is delivered to them.

"We were shopping in Aruba in the cruise ship shopping area (we were not there on a cruise) and decided to go to Lucy’s for a cocktail and a bite to eat. We didn’t want anything heavy as we were scheduled for an early sunset cruise later in the day. We ordered guacamole and chips and two frozen margaritas. We asked the Waitress if the guacamole was fresh in which she replied it was. When it came, the chips were stale and the guacamole was absolutely packaged. I’m not even sure if avocados were even used in it. The margaritas were not horrible but nothing special. We told the waitress about the guacamole and she did promptly refunded the guacamole. That part was good. She was very friendly so there was no issue there. Just a heads up.",0,
Are used to love Google maps and it is still my only GPS system that I use however I’ve noticed in the last few weeks that Google maps continues to glitch. It’s like it’s ultra sensitive I will be driving on the freeway and then for some reason it thinks that I have exited the freeway and it’s trying to reroute me to the freeway but this whole time I’m on the freeway. It just continues to lose my location and thinks that I’m somewhere else and tries to reroute me and it’s really frustrating because if I am on a street trying to see where I’m going and it keeps rerouting I can’t figure out how to arrive at my Destination. I am using an iPhone 8 with the most current iOS operating system.,0,
It’s a great app and I like using the Google map for navigation the only thing that needs to be accurate is the posted speed limits on the roads on the map thru gps. That’s the only thing that needs to be fixed otherwise it’s a great app for me to use. And I love the 3D vehicles that are on the map so please don’t get rid of them when you do the next update on the google map. The only thing that needs to be fixed and accurate is the speed limit and that’s it. Everything else works great.,0,
"This app really needs a new update, where it knows where it’s going. It reroutes while you’re driving on the route it gave you when you are doing as it says to do. It doesn’t take you the fastest route as it is suppose to every once in a blue moon we actually get the fastest route but for the most part it never gives us the fastest route. It has almost caused us to wreck on multiple occasions due to it not telling you to turn before you are suppose to turn it tells you after you already missed the turn. When you’re in a parking lot it doesn’t specify which way to go it just says to go north on whatever street if you have no clue where you are you don’t know what way that is. Please fix these issues with your app.",0,
"Normally this app is helpful when I am going somewhere new and I need turn by turn directions but it is NOT helpful if I am just looking at a route I know to see if there are any slowdowns coming but they do not have them listed! I only was able to see the hour+ slow down coming home from a cabin after I hit start and had missed my ONE opportunity to avoid said slowdown. What should have been a two and a half hour drive home turned into a FOUR HOUR drive of stopped traffic. Oh and also with a super cranky and hungry toddler. If there’s a delay SHOW IT ON ALL OF THE MAPS FOR THE ROUTE NOT JUST WHEN YOU CLICK START! I’m sorry, I know the main highways in my state and don’t need to hear step-by-step directions.

"I love google  maps. I’m a truck driver and I use google maps EVERY SINGLE DAY! I don’t depend on it %100. I use the atlas as well, but without the google maps it’s way harder, I can check the buildings that I'm going to, drop a pin and see the entrance and exit and also gives you variety options and then it’s your choice to choose the right one. Some people complain about that google maps takes them to wrong roads. YOU have to check out the route and CHOOSE and drop a PIN. In that case you won’t be lost.",0,
"Would you consider adding a two-finger touch distance feature so we can estimate the distance between two points on the map without having to restart a navigation? This would be helpful.

I was looking for a resort type of getaway and The Grove Resort and Spa certainly did not disappoint! I was only able to book one night but it was everything I needed . As soon As I walked the place I said to myself “ THIS IS MY SPOT”!

The suites are spacious and have everything you would need as if you were at your own home! I love it and will return soon!,0,
Caleb Lambert is an exceptional young man and needs to be recognized for his great work as well as his personable and optimistic attitude!

"Note to developers: Location sharing feature is great for sharing my commute home with family for safety and ETA. With new version updates it’s been glitchy, having a spinning wheel trying to start. If we could make it easier to share instead of exiting my current map with directions that would be great. For now I have to exit directions, exit to side folder, then into location sharing. Then have to restart my directions.... hands free is no such thing here. Also new versions notes: I don’t want to edit my label accidentally when trying to hit start. Ugh. Change is hard?",0,
"Your service is routing people going from Jackson Wyoming to Salt Lake City on Idaho Highway 34 which connects the Thayne/Etna Wyoming area on US89 with Soda Springs Idaho. This is a narrow ,twisting ,rural Road with lots of turns ,many deer and stock at large. We are old time residents of Jackson Wyoming. And go to Salt Lake City often. We NEVER use Idaho Highway 34 in the winter when it is icy and after dark at any time of the year. There are no services on Idaho. Highway 34 between Highway89 in Wyoming and Soda Springs. Snow plowing on 34 is erratic. The “locals” here use US 26 to Idaho Falls and then I -15 into Salt Lake. Or else we use Highway US89 between Jackson and EVANSTON Wyoming and complete the trip on I-80 into Salt Lake. Most of the time a person can go from Jackson to Victor Idaho on Highway 22 and then from Victor Idaho to Swan Valley on Idaho highway 31.  Idaho Highway 31 meets US 26 at Swan Valley.  Then One proceeds to I-15....Idaho falls, Pocatello, and Ogden. I do not know if this information helps you but most locals avoid Idaho Highway 34 except when conditions are ideal.",0,
"What the... Google clustered click bait within Google Maps.  The screen is cluttered with Uber and Lyft options that make it hard to get simple driving directions without clicking on an ad, link, or Uber/Lyft service.  Completely unintelligent design meant to siphon money out of Uber/Lyft through pay per click advertising.  The end result is that their app is useless.   I found a restaurant that I wanted to drive to and kept clicking on the embedded ads.   I never thought that I would switch back over to Apple Maps.   Google needs to smarten up with the placement of ads.   Click bait is sooo early 2000’s.  Hopefully Apple won’t follow suit with unintelligent design.   I am thoroughly shocked at this.",0,
"When navigating with Google Maps, it would be nice if my “current location” icon on the map were not centered on the map display, but rather off-centered. For example, if driving north, my “current location” icon on the map should be positioned near the bottom of the screen so that as the map scrolls, the majority of the screen displays the road ahead.  Currently the app positions my “current location” icon in the center of the screen which means half of the display is showing a portion of the route already traveled, which is NOT useful information.  Being able to see more of the road ahead, on the other hand, would be quite useful.",0,
"Ever since upgrading to iOS 13, this app has been absolutely horrible to use. It has actually become pretty dangerous because your app can’t even tell you the street to turn onto until after you’ve already made the turn. Of course you can look ahead to read the directions but that actually takes your eyes off the road longer than is safe. Also the gyroscope is very slow so sometimes you think you should go right when you actually need to go left. And other times the app starts freaking out and putting you on the next toad over. This is super dangerous. iOS 13 has been out for a bit now. You guys need to come out with an update before people start getting into accidents.",0,
"As many have said, this app is garbage. The biggest problem is that the GPS doesn’t seem to understand convenience. The app will send you down numerous turns that will take you an extra fifteen minutes, all because the app doesn’t understand how to take the quickest route. In addition, the gps is also inconsistent. One example is the gps will not stop talking, and keep telling you to turn long before your route, or it will suddenly tell you to turn when you are 50 feet from your next turn. Also, the gps will constantly tell you too take geologically impossible turns, such as make a U-turn on the highway, if you miss your exit. All of this could be forgivable, if Google would actually update, and fix this mess.",0,
"I enjoy using Google maps for all. The info that it displays. Not just because it displays then. But it does it well mostly from transit to traffic to street view. Though apple maps is improving, Google maps is still. Better in many ways. Though one wish me I am starting to see in Google maps is inaccuracies such as restaurants where there isn't one and wrong labeling of subway stations. They will. Correct it though if course so it's not too bad.",0,
"Thanks to Google Travel Guide I have been going on road trips to the different places around the Kanto area in Japan at ease with the help of the GTG! This system is available on your smart phone. Just go to Google Search, type in the location where you intend to go and the website will take you to a virtual map and route that is quite accurate and right on to the spot where you intend to go. I’ll use GTG anytime... anywhere! Good work Google! Thanks for making my trips easy... driving can’t be this pleasurable.",0,
"I love this app. I have a horrible sense of direction, so naturally I use it for everything (I don’t like the iOS Maps). However, every once in a while, I will be driving in a downtown area where turns are frequent and important, and the app will freeze, or it will put my location way off somewhere that I am nowhere near to, and it will stay like that for a long time. And because of my lack of sense of direction, I am forced to drive until it unfreezes, and then it takes me an extra 10 minutes to get home. It is the most frustrating thing ever and if this one problem could be fixed this app would be perfect!!",0,
Went out to their Sunday breakfast for a community breakfast. It was extremely satisfying delicious and no long time wait for one of the best omelet stands I have ever encountered. The food was plentiful and fresh. The waitress staff cooks and other personnel were polite on their toes at all times. The restaurant was so nice open and very clean. I highly recommend visiting the Bull N Claw on Route 1 in Wells Maine for their Sunday breakfast which is priced very reasonably from 8 to 11. Also stop in for lunch or dinner. The portions are filling and the prices are again very reasonable. I give it a 5 ALL around Marie of Wells Maine St. Mary’s Church Group,0,
"Undoubtedly google maps is the best but not on iPhone 6. Every time I start routing, for reasons that I can’t comprehend my iPhone 6 goes into “No Service” and maps stop updating. I have to shut the app, restart my phone and start routing all over again. I thought it was my phone at first, but every single time I use google maps, it makes my phone loose connectivity to network and I have to restart everything! It’s very frustrating when you are on a free way and you realize you were supposed to take an exit 20 miles behind and you realize that was because your phone stopped routing!",0,
"Multiple times google maps has taken me off of my route to a slower route with tolls. I have the option for avoiding tolls ticked and google will often take me on a backwards route only to put me on a toll road, costing me money and making my trip longer. Also when driving on a route without tolls it will notify me that it has found a faster route and will automatically switch to that route unless I hit dismiss, which I can’t always do because I am driving... it doesn’t notify you that this faster route includes tolls. I shouldn’t have to do a full analysis of my route (while driving!) to be able to avoid tolls, especially when I already have “avoid tolls” ticked. Very frustrating",0,
This helps me find new places to bike because I’m into long distance riding and I love to find new mountain trails. I use this paired with google earth. I also use it in the car for long vacations and stuff. It’s really good except maybe add the ability to have a custom route from the start because sometimes I like to cruise through residential areas as much as I can so I would like to change the route from start. However it is still a 5 star because when you go the desired route it reroutes for you,0,
"The cabinets were delivered on the day and time as scheduled. Ten minutes before arriving I received a call informing me of there pending arrival. The deliverymen were efficient and courteous. Two concerns: the automated call I received days in advance of the delivery malfunctioned, stopping and starting repeatedly, then abruptly hung up. I was able to discern the delivery date/time though. Second concern is that I must sign for receipt of the delivery, but there is no clear manner to determine what you are receiving or whether it is all there. The consumer is left to rely on the company’s scanner that the right number of boxes was delivered.",0,

They made our experience a fun exciting time, one that I normally dread! Thank you Derrick and Alex!",0,
"I used Google Maps for the first time this weekend on my way back to NY from FL. I enjoyed the simplicity of the controls and the guidance. My only issue was the speed limits weren’t always accurate like they are in Waze, which I use more often. For example the New Jersey Turnpike has a 65mph limit but the entire time Google maps still said 55mph. That is something that’s very important to me. It happened in a few other states as well. That’s just something that needs to be reviewed. Other than that, I love the interface and I’ll definitely use it again.",0,
"I love the Google Maps App! It’s my exclusive travel companion all around the country and I’ve almost never had an issue with routing. I am an over the road truck driver and this is still my go to map service while on the road, however there are some roads that 18-wheelers cannot safely or legally travel on and other areas that have low bridges/overpasses/tunnels. If Google could provide a service specific to those of us who are on the road every minute of every day, making deliveries across the nation and even the world, it would be appreciated beyond words!",0,
"Google Maps allows locals to be ‘guides’ in that they can help tourists and even locals discover and have improved-visits and experiences by allowing ‘guides’ leave reviews, locations, hours, both the positives and negatives of everything from restaurants to fast-food to outlet malls to museums and even health/medical clinics and hospitals. Its fantastic and I recommend this for every tourist, from John Doe to Jeff Bezos. No one is too well-informed: we all co-exist and we can all improve our amazing areas we live and vacation and even perhaps drive through on the way to a more-distant location.",0,
"Most recently If my google maps is not up to date, it glitches and does not load where I am currently am. It won’t calculate the distances correctly or show the correct amount of time it takes to get to a location. I use google maps for all my traveling needs. It is frustrating when it’s not working correctly especially when I really don’t know where I am going. Most of the time I like to know the ETA so I know an accurate time of arrival. Other than that I love google maps. I love that it saves all my locations and I can find anywhere that I need to go. I would recommend it to everyone.",0,

"Generally speaking it’s good enough to get you where you asked to be directed. However, it is persistent on taking you a different route that you have preselected.

While driving if you choose zoom in/out it will revert immediately your actions causing a lot of frustration! Occasionally is doesn’t use common sense.

"I’ve always believed that Google provided the best maps. However, in the recent months I’ve noticed a Google maps is very slow at updating and takes a very long time to pull navigation information. Apple Maps definitely has Google maps been in the time it takes to update and the time it takes to show you where to get off that. I’m also Lyft driver and I have to say that using Google maps while doing Lyft is very cumbersome and often incorrect. It gives me incorrect locations and often will even give me incorrect exit ramps to take causing very distressed customers.

"What was once a great app and go-to for daily navigation is slowly turning into a burden to use. With incorrect house numbers and street names, I’ve had to correct their problems 3 times already and took to making labels of my own to make it that much more easier and handy for me. Well they removed the feature to add labels and now it’s the same old frustrating. I have half a mind to create a map app of my own to satisfy my own needs. with how much problems this has you’d think it was created by college kids and definitely not locals of the cities it serves to populate. Too many incorrect addresses and no labeling system? What are you thinking Google?",0,
"Hey google - on behalf of us city folks I have a suggestion. When I ask for my directions on public transportation, google maps always assumes that I minimizing walking time is the objective, which means my route options always have a ton of transfers to different train or bus lines even if I’m only on it for a short distance. In fact I’m OK with walking a few extra blocks if it takes me to a more efficient public transit option. Could you build an option such as “turn off routes with bus/train transfers” or something?",0,
"Over the past year plus the Google Maps app slowly decreased in quality from the interference from touch/click events (captures everything except my taps of search results) to quality of directions (walking 950m takes 2 minutes, those engineers a freaky fast—and why can't I stop at that subway station anymore?). Not sure what's happening beyond a general decline in core feature quality while adding additional features that futher obscure basic map functionality in the limited available space. It's a good time for a competitor to rise to the occasion. Maps will always be a solid need.",1,Thanks for your review!

"I drive a truck and I have been using Google Maps for years. It has been great and is constantly improving until this last upgrade. It won’t reroute if you deviate from the original route. For example, if it routes me through the middle of Atlanta and I take the 285 perimeter route around Atlanta, the mileage and time at the bottom of the screen goes blank and the navigation at the top of the screen disappears. If I exit the existing trip and begin a new one from my location it all starts working again. It was a better app before this last update and I hope they are able to fix this.",0,

"It's been years since Google Maps on iOS. Still Google Maps doesn't treat you as a car when you choose to drive and doesn't treat you as a person when you choose to walk. 1. Add the arrow that points you the direction one step ahead! Please do that if that next turn or lanes change happens within 1 km away of the current one! 2. Treat me as a person when I choose to walk! Google Maps always, always points me a direction where there's no walking path for a walking person. It points me to walk along the freeway with high-speed cars side by side. At least show people there's danger! 3. Treat me as a car when I choose to drive! Similar to 2., my car is not a superhero movie car. And be determined! 10 seconds after I choose a direction, and before I turn, it changes to the alternative one!

"Despite the fact the pre-filled in review said it is “The Best!” it really isn’t any more. It was always my favorite gps, but it loses track of me (claiming I’m drive in a field when I am halfway through a fifty miles straight path) and tells me to make turns with little warning so I am constantly missing turns. Once it told me to drive more than fifteen miles east on the highway when I live fifteen miles west of my starting point! It added a half hour or more to my trip!! Please fix the actual gps features! I have google on my browser to look up locations, now I need an app I can trust to get there.",0,
"I have used Google Maps for many years. I currently use it all day everyday to route myself between sales stops. The problems started a few months ago when it would lose my location all together in the middle of a drive. I could close it and start back again but 5 minutes later it would happen again. I uninstalled the app and reinstalled hoping it would fix my issue which it did, for a while. Now my issue is that I’m driving and the icon shows me in the correct location but the routing function thinks I’m driving the opposite direction and it immediately begins to reroute me down streets i passed 2 miles ago and aren’t even on the screen. So frustrating! For the love of god please fix this issue.",0,
"The new update is unreliable and dangerous. Turn by turn navigation is horrible and dangerous as it does not properly sync with car. The gps is inaccurate - keeps showing my car is on service road when I am on a highway and thus giving me inaccurate directions in the middle of planned trip confusing the driver. The touch response is laggy, turn by turn navigation is super slow - the map does not follow car when driving. I already turn left in the intersection and move about 100 meters, but the map shows I am going in the direction 90 degrees of my actual path which requires me to think if I have taken a right way. Again, this is extremely dangerous while driving. Please fix this.",0,
"[Update: they added the route back to the widget. Back up to 5 stars.] I brought my review down from 5 stars. The ""Travel Times"" widget for your places that are labeled ""home"" and ""work was handy because it used to tell you which route to take (in my case I have three different routes I can take to work, depending on traffic). Now, it just tells you the time it will take, but you have to open the app to see the best route. It sounds small, but it's a big irritation to me and it belongs in the widget.",0,
"I’m so very pleased with this app as it has evolved and I think of only two more things I wish it would do. One of those may already be available and just beyond my expertise. When I stop for gas or a quick meal, I’d like for it to “shut up” at a quick touch (not going to the sound and turning the sound off — remember, I’m DRIVING, and I need to pay attention to the road and the proper turns into the gas station). So just a quick toggle which can just as quickly be reversed when I’m reading to resume the trip. The other thing is that I’d like it to show me how fast I’m driving. Car speedometers are not accurate. WAZE does display both posted and actual speeds. I’d like to have that. What I BEST LIKE about this app is the lane prediction announcements. Knowing in advance that I can “use either of the two left lanes” (etc.) is MOST helpful.",0,
"I use this on my iPhone 11. Before I got this phone I had a Galaxy. So I was used to using Google Maps. Then when I got the iPhone, I decided to give Apple Maps a try. Well, that didn’t last long at all. Google Maps has way better selections and the routes are always correct and the quickest. Albeit, like any GPS app, sometimes it will take you on the “scenic route”, if you will, to go to some places, but overall I would much rather have Google Maps than any other app.",0,
"Several features available on the web site just don’t exist for the app: you can't plan travel by adjusting (click and drag) the route nor can you get info on when to leave to arrive at a specific time (or how long it might take if you leave at a given time). Add to that the goofy directions (go past this intersection with the nice, protected left turn lane and signal, then make an illegal u-turn to come back to the intersection and turn right). Since this app can’t manage to offer reasonable behavior, I’m using the web site for travel planning and a different app for route navigation. Looks like I could delete this app and not miss it.",0,
"I need to switch off toll routes. I’m tired of getting routes for a destination and it routes me to a toll. If it’s a two minute trip it will route me to a toll, sometimes the route is twice as far.

Without this, I don’t know what we would’ve done. Other competitors map applications lacked and were never updated throughout the storm.",0,

"Google maps appears to be falling on hard times.  It used to be near perfect and far surpassed iOS maps.  Over the last few months it appears incredibly glitchy, with white boxes routinely flashing on and off the screen as I try to use it to navigate.  It also struggles a little in congested route areas, sometimes getting confused with what road I am on.  I got so fed up with the flashing white squares I switched to iOS maps on my last return from New York and was pleasantly surprised at how well it performed and by many improvements that bring it closer in line with google but without the glitches.  Until google irons those out it is the inferior of the two.",0,
"I still use Apple Maps from time to time if I don’t want to scroll pages to this app. This app is fairly solid. The interface, the explore nearby, traffic and so on. The only downside is that in street view you need to switch to the other street in order to continue on the street you are on. And it is buggy sometimes too. One feature that would be a great addition is connection to other apps. Like Yelp or Pokémon Go or NextBus. I know the Explore Nearby is similar to Yelp and is a decent option, but if you have Yelp connection it could show places that you have a positive experience at nearby. Or if I wanted to check the bus schedule through NextBus it would be helpful to click on a bus stop and see when the bus is coming. And if I’m walking somewhere and need to use this app and also play Pokémon Go it would be nice to add a Pokémon spawn option to let you know to go to PGO.",0,
"I used O’Neal Furniture Assembly about 6 months ago to assemble my Ikea bed and sofa-convertible bed. About a week ago my sofa was disengaged from the bed. I tried to fix it myself but could not so I called the company. I was referred to a guy named Monroe in San Antonio because the former guy that did the assembly initially had moved to CA. This Monroe guy after asking me some questions, picked the detached piece and just put it together in less than 5 minutes and told me it was done. At first I did not understand what he meant so I asked him to explain to so he said there was nothing to repair that I did something wrong when I pulled out the bed part so he showed me the correct way to do it the next time that happen. Can you imagine if he was not honest how he could have ripped me off? I recommend O’Neal Furniture Assembly to anyone who needs a professional furniture assembly by a reputable company.

"Seriously, if there is one app that continually disappoints me it’s this! I cannot stress this enough. There’s no “don’t lead me through dirt routes or scary curvy roads instead of the freeway option”. I mean, sure google maps might work if you live in a big city. But don’t you ever drive out of the big cities to get to a destination. Instead of taking you to your destination on a safe and direct route, it leads you through neighborhoods and dirt roads just to maybe save 2 minutes? At this point it’s better to just look at a map. And don’t get me started on their outdated map data! I’ve been traveling through the same new freeway stretch for years now and it still hasn’t figured this out. Really, I’m switching to Apple Maps for good!",0,
They needs to fix their bugs as soon as possible. I use it as regular basis. Yesterday while on driving I found out after taking turns they failed to show next immediate  exit on highway which leads me to take wrong exits. Delay to reach the destination. However the apps was better before updating it. In comparison to waze. Waze is good and shows in details but some times I feel like waze is slow and their graphics are irrelevant to real view.,0,
Google maps is great! It’s always accurate. I have two rebuttals unfortunately. I don’t like how google maps always puts you on the freeway or highway even if the place one mile away or even less it will put you on the freeway or highway and I don’t think that is needed. Also sometime the app can be confusing because it’ll be turned around the opposite way you’re driving which has caused me to miss exits for example it’ll tell me to make a left when I should make a right!!,0,
Soon it will be 20 yrs that I've been a patient of College Park. Almost that entire time has been with Dr Greg Chambon.

Advice on how to manage conditions both medically and financially. The nursing staff is caring and admin team does a great job managing claims and appointments. The team of doctors can address almost any concern. As a health advisory team of professionals I would give them my highest recommendation. J Giesler Lenexa KS.,0,
"I travel, for my job, across the United States on a regular basis. I am pretty much directionally challenged and I would be absolutely lost without this app. This app works almost as well when it loses gps signal. I have noticed that the only times I find myself lost or turned around are when I decide I don't need directions (mistake on my part) or when I am forced to be without it (like today when my phone gave out and I had to find my way to the store for a new one in the middle of Minnesota).",0,
"I used to rely on this app all the time. It always got me wherever I needed to go on time and took me around accidents and other issues. Lately, though, I’ve stopped using it because it directs me the same way every day, even if there are accidents and/or faster routes. It wants me to get off at the busiest exit in my city when there are two other less busy exits that will get me there faster every time. It stopped giving me shortcuts and now I take my chances going a quicker way I know and hoping there are no issues. It’s really a shame that I can’t count on this app anymore...not sure what changed for them.",0,
"I been using google maps for years and I liked the new features with the Uber, but now the issue is getting worse. Every time I’m driving down 75 south into Ohio, where the new construction was they rename the highway signs and google maps have the old highway signs and I keep going off in the Wong direction. That’s very irritating. Then the next issue with map is that a Several different occasions when I’m driving the map will take you off the freeway and have you go around and get back on the freeway just wasting time. I don’t understand why it takes you off the freeway just to put you back on the freeway a few miles down. And it was NOT Heavy traffic or accident-ridiculous. So, I started using Waze much better.",0,
"Google maps has been my map tool of choice for many years but recent updates are flawed. Things that used to work well are broken. For example, I use google maps to navigate the Tokyo transit system. Google Maps used to do this with aplomb but no longer. My biggest complaint is that Google Maps no longer shows all the alternate train options; only the “recommended” route. Anyone who rides trains in Tokyo knows that the trains become extremely crowded at times.  It maybe better to ride a slower local train where you can get a seat, than a standing room only express train.  I used the local train options but no longer.",0,
"Update: I sent the info below to Google via the Feedback menu in the app, and received a response within 48 hrs saying they’d fixed the issue. App is working again for me.

Every location just tells me “There was a problem with that suggestion...” and tapping on a business just drops a pin instead of showing me the business info.",0,

"Thought that was just only me, however some other people (using iPhone 6 or iPhone 6s) around also had the same problem.

One time I have to stop 4 times in a 40-minute driving. When I use other map apps, they didn’t show this problem so I assume the new update or something went wrong. I always love google map, but this is not safe for me to use since I have to drive to a lot of new places. Hope this can be solved.",0,
"I drive hot-shot courier and use navigation tools every day. Google is much more reliable than Apple, and because Google usually tells which side of street the destination is on, I prefer Google to Waze. The only consistent problem I have is when Google Maps is invoked by another app such as Road Warrior or ecMobile, Google Maps doesn’t use its use its saved setting, such as “avoid tolls”. I have to remember and take time to change the setting every time I use navigation. Without changing the settings, Google Maps may route me over $10 in tolls to save less than 1 minute in time.",0,
This is the best map I highly recommend this it’s better than apples map because this one just asks for location the other one asks where you wanna go this is why I would recommend you guys should download this is 100 times better than Waze not that you could see the accident in google map you can report an issue in apple map it doesn’t have that feature this is why I use google maps than any other navigation apps because this is the best.,0,

After I got out of that mess, it told me to go straight and take a u-turn at the end of a road to turn into the parking lot of the store. It was finally making sense, so I went down the road it told me to. However, when I got to where it was telling me to u-turn, there was a “left only” sign.

"Hands down Google Maps is the cleanest, most efficient, and easily searchable navigation app for iPhone. Apple Maps is pretty bad, Waze is middle ground but sometimes confusing, and Google Maps is the gold standard.

Great work and I hope they keep improving routing and navigation along with adding new features.",0,
"We love using Google Maps to navigate cross-country roadtrips, trek European cities, or just find my kid’s friend’s birthday party. The only annoying feature is the auto-reroute it often conducts on longer trips and in the city to shave off minutes.

Sometimes I don’t want a reroute or must drive a certain way I’ve planned, and don’t want changes to this plan made automatically. Perfect map app with this change.",0,

"When driving on the expressway, it sometimes routes me off the expressway, then back on at the same exit or one farther down my route. For example when traveling South on I35, it took me off at exit 319 and brought me back the next exit. I just stayed on the expressway and there were no problems. I like the it lets me search for hotels, restaurants and things along my route. I switched from iPhone maps to Google Maps years ago, but the primary function is to route me where I want to go and Google Maps is not doing it. Going back to iPhone maps until you get it fixed",0,
"Starting about a year ago (and a couple iPhones ago) I found that google maps started struggling when using navigation and driving. Somewhat randomly, the app would decide I was facing and driving in the exact opposite direction. This basically makes the app useless. I thought that maybe it would get better with app updates (it didn’t), then maybe thought upgrading my phone would help (it didn’t). I’ve moved over to Apple Maps somewhat against my will because of this issue. Since getting in contact with Google is slightly harder than having a sit-down meeting with Santa Claus, I’m hoping that maybe a low-star review will get noticed (although I doubt it...)",0,

Maybe it's a regional issue (Iran) and/or your dev team knows the issue and doesn't care enough to fix this issue. Instead of fixing, they tell user the famous ""go restart and try again"" BS.",1,Sorry to hear about this issue. Can you please try restarting your device? You can also see if uninstalling Google Maps and reinstalling it fresh from the App Store helps solve this problem.
Long time veteran user of Google Maps. Freezing issues have been resolved on the latest iOS and I have switched back (from Waze). The only issue I see as a bug recently with GMaps is the search bar being shown out of proportion. The bar appears thin and sometimes clicking in the search bar when I am on the phone or have the hotspot leads to misclicks. Seems that the bar is adjusting to the full-screen resolution rather than moving to accommodate the iOS notification bar when on the phone or using hotspot.,1,3/7/18 Are you still experiencing this? 11/15/17 Thank you for reporting this issue. Are you still experiencing this on the latest version of Google Maps?
"In response to Norway772, I’ve been using Google maps for a while and the freezing began with the last update but whenever this happens just tap the arrow on the screen it will reposition itself and continue to give directions if you miss your exit it will tell you how to get back or direct you at the next exit. I love this app. WAY better than the Apple Maps. It is always accurate and will NOT have you going out of the way when your destination was much closer.",0,
"The exit numbers are hard to find. Another thing that makes me miss old paper maps is the detail AND overall view, that is, the detail gets lost when you zoom out, even though the screen can handle the detail. I wish there was a setting option to enable this. But again, Google Maps is awesome and thank you for many years of finding our way with it!",0,
This may have something to do with the inpenetrable nature of some areas to technology. I’ve been making a regular commute up a well traveled route that follows the coast of Lake Michigan through the west part of the state.  Traffic wait time predictions have been nonexistent for trip that sometimes take an extra 45 minutes to complete. This is for a one hour and 30 minute trip.  Could this app include the ability for drivers to enter information specific to back ups as they occur in real time?  I would love a good old “cb radio-like” situation here on Google Maps.

"This app is great when you need to get around in the moment but it’s absolute trash when you need to plan your commute or a trip during rush hour.

I deleted Maps for IOS on Apple because it was so dysfunctional and would make me miss exits and take me pointless ways all the way around my destination. I wouldn’t even know which way I was facing 90% of the time I was “driving sideways” Google maps actually has it down and is the only app I trust.

It would be super convenient if I could save those important addresses so I can easily set my destination instead of writing out the entire address every time. Other than that, I love it.",0,
"I’ve always been a fan and user of Google Maps as priority over any other navigation app. I was elated once they finally updated the app to be used with CarPlay. A couple areas that need attention or improvement, related to CarPlay only: 1) pan &amp; zoom - the pan feature is laggy and the inability to zoom on the display is prohibitive when navigating an area you’re unfamiliar with; 2) when the auto zoom-out feature is activated while driving, street names disappear (as with #1, when navigating an unfamiliar area, it’d be nice to see street names or have the ability to zoom in/out).",0,

I now regret having automatic updates on. I’m really hoping this is a glitch but I can no longer view my saved/starred places on the map. I can only scroll through the profiles which is horrible especially if you starred in different countries. The list is merged and I can no longer zoom in on a map area to see pins.

I use the app on a daily basis. For the the most part it is great and I have no problems. Now here is the problem. I drive a commercial vehicle. I wish I was able to change a setting so the app would recognize I am in a truck and am not allowed on certain roads. I know that is asking a lot but having to constantly reroute because my utility truck is not allowed on the north Garden State parkway is annoying. I know it would be troublesome to do all the roads that do not allow commercial trucks on them but the major highways would be nice. Until then only 3 stars because of all the rerouting,0,

"I’ve been using Google maps for years now and it’s the best travel app by far over all others my job takes me all over the state of CT and I use this app every day and it never fails to get me there and all the features they keep adding forget about it better and better each time the real time updates are great because I’m all about saving time and getting out of traffic and Google Maps is what gets me there wouldn’t trust any other app, Google is the only one I need.",0,
"This used to be my go-to map. I travel every day. The last few updates have demolished this app. It takes forever to load, the map will not update while en route (icon freezes). Then if it does start to work, the app freezes while en route, and then freezes while driving, the arrow/car icon won’t update/follow you while driving. “Did I turn the right way? Oh, oops! I’m suppose to go the opposite way!” *turns around, drives back the opposite way*. Then the icon updates and duh (!) I was going the right way the whole time. The freaking GOOGLE map can’t update and doesn’t know crap. And I LIVE IN ATLANTA! Not some random small town with no signal. Get it together, Google. I LOATHE Waze. But Waze, here I come.",1,Thanks for your review! Check out some tips from our Help Center on how to improve the apps speed as this is the likely cause of what you are seeing: https://goo.gl/GW6uOo
"I simply cannot imagine my life without Google Maps It opens the way for me to go wherever I need to , and especially in my job where I don’t have time to ask for directions or gamble around the traffic mazes ! To the point.. when and where you need it And being able to save places into my Google account is a BIG advantage over any other rival app .. simply I no longer worry about my device ! I have places stored and labelled &gt; 5 yrs ago back when I used my PC ! All together with my last trip details and the ones that I’m planning to visit .. all in one single place , that I can access from anywhere, with any device , and I’m like 100% sure I can share it to anyone and they can definitely get the directions no matter what device they’re using ! That’s a point that NO other service can hit , other than Google ❤️",0,
"Great travel aid. Uses local transportation like as buses, trains, ferry as a mode of travel. Walking or by car as a alternate aid getting to your destination. Pretty accurate and you get a preview of your destination to get a idea of the lay of the land. Eta is good to know how far to travel. Makes for a good vacation planner. Pictures might be a year or more dated but close enough for me for the view. Got good idea of traffic along your route so you can plan detours. You don’t have to pay to update like you do with any of the other gps units.",0,
As they say Google Maps is great when it works just like other parts of the Internet! I would say that usually it works on my phone but there's been some times where it just doesn't always like me! Google Maps has acted really slowly at times when getting to my destinations but for the most part it works well! It's really convenient for me when my family and I don't know how to get to places! You should use this if your somebody who is not good with directions but just keep in mind that it might be a little funky once in a blue moon or a lot of the time!,0,
"While I love this app and it is my most used, I was recently made aware of a big flaw. I was on the way home from a trip to the coast and was unaware that this side had a toll bridge. It would’ve been nice to have a warning that this route has a toll bridge. As a result we received a ticket for far more than the $5 in cash that we didn’t have. There were other routes as we have been to this place once before and never had a toll bridge on the way back but this time we were taken a different route. I would’ve gladly taken the longer route to avoid the toll as our FastTrak was in our other car.",0,
"In fact, I’m very frustrated. Please bring back the route option so I can see all of my routes tolls roads or not. This last update has it so that if the toll road option is chosen I don’t get to see travel time for non-toll roads or optional routes. Another frustration is that when I change course the map does not re-route automatically it can take up to a half a mile or more. Living in LA area causes me to get off the freeway to avoid traffic or accidents and take alternate routes but now Google maps does not reroute quick enough. At this point iMaps is more helpful, but I terribly dislike iMaps. So please fix this. Then you’ll get your 5 stars. Thanks!",0,
"I don’t know which version made this change, but I noticed while driving I now have to Opt out of route changes. This is a terrible idea. I missed one while driving in driving rain today, so instead of taking the ‘longer route’ that had 2 lanes, I get stuck on a 1 lane road behind people driving 10 miles below the speed limit. If it had just stayed with the route I had chosen, I wouldn’t have wasted an hour and a 1/2 today. First thing I do when I get home is look to change the settings, but nope, not possible. If this isn’t fixed soon, I will switch to Apple Maps - I shouldn’t have to wrestle with my GPS while driving...",0,
"I’ve used only google maps for over a year now because it was so much better than apple maps. I’m about to delete it and download something else. I have to use GPS everyday for work and for about a month or more it has been messing up on every trip. It thinks I’m on a completely different road than I am, doesn’t show the route, lags behind, or doesn’t give me any instructions. My husband has been having issues as well and both our apps are up to date. We can not understand how an app that used to be so great has fallen so low. It’s extremely frustrating and I just don’t have the patience to deal with it anymore.",0,
"I have an older car, and like all older cars the stereo placement is much lower than in newer cars. So my CarPlay capable head unit is nowhere near my dashboard, yet my phone is mounted right in my field of view for easy and safe navigation. Before CarPlay was enabled google maps was my go to application, since they enabled it, the phone display becomes USELESS for navigation. Turn by turn with no graphics is absolutely worthless, and it’s not safe to be constantly looking down to my stereo screen which is way out of my field of view. GOOGLE THIS IS A POOR AND UNSAFE FEATURE. Please fix this or at least make it an optional setting. Otherwise I will never be able to use this app for navigation again.",0,
"I loved google maps and would turn on every where I went, however with the 2 last updates my app is having a lot of glitches. The one that is the worst is that it randomly stops announced narration which is very annoying and dangerous, have to be looking at the app in order to see turn by turn directions. I’ve tried everything deleted and reinstalled app and changed app settings and nothing seems to work. I hope google gets these glitches fixed. It was working fine before these updates were made.",0,
It’s great that you have speed limits on many of the roads now on the map. But I hate the feature where an alternate route that’s faster comes up in route. Tap “yes I’ll take it” or “no I reject it “. I haven’t checked out enough to know if the suggestion will just go away but it had better. Very distracting if you’re asking me to tap just to stay with the route that I’m going on. I’ve had it come up three times so far and this is not something we’re supposed to be messing with in our new hands-free law state (Mn).,0,
I’ve been devoted exclusively to Google Maps for years. Even with Waze and Apple Maps getting so much better I stuck with them. Was a great product. Fast forward to getting the iPhone X and the app is HORRIBLY inefficient with the new screen. No updates besides moving ‘satellite &amp; layers’ slightly (which is still infuriating since I’ve been used to it in the same place for 5 years). Searched locations are sometimes inaccurate now and overall I couldn’t be less upset that I have to use another app for my maps now. Will continue to review for them for the sake of other Google users but will not be using this for GPS for the foreseeable future,0,
"Google Maps is my go-to GPS and always has been, but lately I’ve had to use Apple maps because it’s been having so many glitches. Most of the time, the directions seem to take me a longer way than is logical for 30-minute drives, and it freezes for no reason when I need it. The app also glitches with the voice saying one direction and the visual map telling me something else. For example, just tonight the voice told me to turn left, but the arrow on the map told me to turn right. This app needs a serious update to deal with all of these glitches!",0,
Have to give it a 2 for now until it is fixed. Haven’t been on it in a while but had to bring my sister somewhere and knew I can trust google maps to show us how to get there cause it never failed me in the past. But now I’m very disappointed. The time to get there was three times wrong. Tired to make me go the wrong way down one way streets. Couldn’t reroute me. Normally love using it and hope they will fix it soon but have to use something else for now.,0,
"I’ve been a reliable Google Maps user for several years and have never had huge problems with it. Over the past week or so, I’ve been noticing that the app has stopped functioning as it should. After I enter my destination address and continue on my drive, the blue arrow just spins around and doesn’t go anywhere as I drive in real time. I’ve seen other users complain about this issue and I was hoping that the latest Google Maps upgrade containing bug fixes would solve the problem, but it seems like Google developers are still  unaware of this bug. Fortunately, Apple Maps has improved a lot over the years, so I’ve switched to that for my GPS needs.",0,
"Google Maps has the most info on most of the places I need, and the user interface is seamless. However, I have had to uninstall and reinstall the app several times recently to deal with bugs such as all my cached maps disappearing, and my starred places showing up with names but no star icons. For a while, all my hotels were only showing in a currency of a country I visited for 24h, even months after I left that country. The desktop version of maps was correctly showing prices in dollars.",0,
"... When I open Google maps. This is a HUGE problem because the labels, favorites and stars are 80% of the reason I use google maps. Hopefully this update will fix the issue! *** SUGGESTION:  Several times now, I’ve wished google’s navigation (routes and alternative routes) offered a “scenic route” alternative.  This might not be realistic, but I would love to see this or something similar added to the google maps route choices - in addition to the no tolls/freeways/ferries options currently offered. ***",0,
"It gets you there great. I have an issue with the very short notice of a turn. If I’m going 55 down a 4 lane road and I have a turn coming up, it only gives notice if turn 1/4 mile before. The road is very congested and going 50, if I’m in the far lane and have to turn from the other(3 lanes over), by the time I can move through traffic to that lane, I’m 1/2 mile or more past my turn.

"My Google Maps has not been working for some time. I have downloaded and re-downloaded and it still will not work. I cannot get the voice feature to work. It was working fine for a while, and about eight months ago just stopped. I have an iPhone 6S and I know that is an older phone but I have not seen any alerts that Google maps will not work on this version of iPhone. The sounds settings on my iPhone are where they should be and the settings in Google Maps are set to loud voice instructions. Very frustated. Meanwhile my husband has the same iPhone, and his Google maps works a little better but more often than not in the middle of traveling it will suddenly stop working.",0,
"I love Google maps and use it much more then I use iMaps. But if there is one thing that I would like to see improved, it would be relocating the button that centers the map over your location. Right now, it is in an area that can easily be touched. It should be down, and out of the way so you don’t accidentally touch it and unwittingly re-center the map when you don’t want to. Please re-locate the centering button. It would make using the app much better",0,

"I always use google maps. But after this last update It won’t track my location accurately. It almost seems to freeze and get all disoriented. It normally corrects itself after about 3 min but at times it has shown me about a mile away from where I actually was. Traffic times also are not accurate.

Other than this, it’s a great app.",0,
"I live in the DFW area and this app has been crucial to my own survival and accessibility.  The public transit tab is VERY detailed and will always provide multiple options to take to get you where you need to go fast.

Some of the directions are not accurate or practical. I will be on a 45 mph road and told toturn 30feet before on a busy road or highway . Also I check out your directions on familiar routes.

"Up until recently I have used google maps consistently. The other day I tried it and it couldn’t seem to figure out my location. It was close but not correct. It also lost the location and direction more than it found it. I thought it was due to it being a cloudy day, which has never been an issue before. However today it was clear and sunny and the app couldn’t find the highway I was on or direct me around slow traffic. It sadly was unusable.

"This update needs to be removed/corrected ASAP. It has been giving me wrong directions, telling me to get off the wrong exits, NOT telling me when to get off, telling me to go left when it shows to turn right, etc. I had a cross country trip this weekend and it was an absolute disaster due to Google Maps, all of the errors added extra time and stress to an already stressful day. I’m not sure what the heck happened with this update because Google Maps has been running flawlessly for over a decade already, but if Google doesn’t get their stuff together and corrects these issues, I'm switching to Apple Maps. Google Maps is useless at the moment and provides wrong information. FIX THIS",0,
"Google Map is working great until the new iOS update! It kept rerouting when I was driving on the highway because it through I was off the highway. It happened on both my iPhone 8 and iPhone X. At first, I thought it could be just the cloudy day, but it happened on a sunny days as well. Google map is the only map I use every day, and I really don’t trust the Apple map because it send me to wrong address many times before! Please help us fix this! Thanks",0,
"This app doesn’t sync to other certain apps (like yelp) which makes it harder to navigate, I can’t simply click on the address and have it start giving me directions.

Then, I parked at a certain place, got into another car and started using my navigation and it got all confused telling me to go back to my parked car!

"Dear Google Maps Update Manager, I have enjoyed using Google Maps for the last several years. It has been a great and useful app...until the latest update. I don’t like that it’s preset now to reverse orientation. I don’t like that it doesn’t show the address and the directions anywhere once you turn on the navigation. And I don’t like the way you changed how one begins navigation, moreover, how you changed the interface. It’s more complicated now, in line with the trend of in the Tech world as seems to be what everyone one in the tech world wants feeble attempt to “add more” where less is better. I have similar issues with Apple updates and the new Yahoo Mail interface, which is why continue to use the old interface on that one. If anyone at Google actually reads this review, I hope that you make these changes and turn things back to the way they were in your app. I would really appreciate it👍🏾. Sincerely, Seth",0,
"Over the past recent weeks when I’ve used the app it force closes it self . When ever i open up the app , it only stays open for about 30 seconds before it shuts down &amp; goes back to its main screen. I haven’t yet tried to uninstall then reinstall the app, maybe if i do that would help ? Other than these glitches in the past few days the app has be great. Thankfully i haven’t had to go anywhere with a location i didn’t know or i would’ve been screwed .",0,
TL;DR - annoying janky directions are needlessly complex/ convoluted. App needs a “most direct route” setting. This app gives the most absurd directions. Often it makes you drive in circles to avoid a “slow down”. Those slow downs are usually simple red lights and the detour google makes you take adds considerable time and annoyance. A friend told me google uses “real time routes” from other people ... there’s the problem. There needs to be a preference for “least amount of turns” or “most direct” route. I mean seriously google once routed my trip through a home depot parking lot only to have me get right back on the street I was previously on to avoid the stop light. Completely ridiculous.,0,
"I love google maps much much more than apples terrible maps app (tongue twister). But there are annoying glitches, two of which drive me nuts. The major one is that my app refuses to show me transit routes. The estimated time pops up, but when K click to see it, it’s “no results”. YEAH OKAY. I check online, and there it shows. So please FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, FIX THIS GLITCH. Another that I’ve dealt with silently for a while but will bring up here is that no matter how many times I change my web activity sharing/tracking (it’s always on) settings, I still can’t create labels or do anything that you could do when it is on. Doesn’t matter if I do it on desktop, I sign out and sign in, or I delete the app and redownload. IT. NEVER. WORKS.",0,
I loved this app before the update! It always takes me on a route that is longer and out of the way...one time it even took me on a route through a really sketchy part of town when my destination was about 4 blocks away! I use this app a lot for traveling and since I am not familiar with the places I visit (obviously) this was always a great way to get around. Now I am having to really second guess the routes! In order to get to my destination without spending an extra hour driving I am having to input an extra stop just to get to where I want to go! Super frustrating and for a female traveling alone it’s not very safe!,0,
"Google is far superior then apple crap maps . I use it all the time with work. My only complaint or I would give you a 5 star, that’s how much this annoys me, sometimes when I go to start navigating. It only give me the option to preview route or show steps. Who the hell needs a preview option just start it and move the screen around. This is most annoying because you have to kill the app or type the address in manually to get it right.",0,

"I have my settings saved to avoid tolls &amp; remember settings, however, everytime I put an address I have to change the settings to avoid tolls even though I have it on remember settings. Multiple times I think I'm leaving on time and then I realize it's taking me to a toll and I change it and it adds a couple more minutes. I hate toll fees, I would rather drive longer than pay them.

"I was looking for the closest places to get a haircut near a particular restaurant. There were several nearby that I knew about that were not showing up, and I later discovered there was one LITERALLY next door. I wondered if I had messed up, so I opened the app later and tried the search again. I made sure I was searching the area near the restaurant, and I tried a few different search terms, but the same thing happened. I tried zooming in to check out each business and it still wouldn’t show up so I thought maybe it just wasn’t in the system. But what made me the most frustrated was when I started typing in the name of the hair studio in the search bar and it automatically popped up. There it was, directly next door to the restaurant, correctly identified as a hair salon. This is the main reason I use google maps. I want to find particular things in neighborhoods or areas I’m not familiar with. Why couldn’t Google Maps pull up the closest hair related businesses to the restaurant?",0,
"This app always takes me the long way. There are always either highways, or one long road that takes me to my house, ( that lyft and Uber don’t take for some inconvenient dumb reason) quicker because I live in a populated area,  but this app always takes me the longest way home for no reason. From by the mall it takes me all the way through Jenkins (which takes 10 minutes), when up through shallowford and on the highway only takes 6-7 minutes. and there are so many other examples I just don’t have the characters to type em.i wish I could for you, and I wish this app was better, I like the way it function s, but to be completely honest, overall it’s just trash.",0,
"I know you might find it hard to understand, but back in “my day”...we didn’t have all this technology.

Within a minute we were on our way and heading in the right direction!",0,
"I tried out google maps to see how it compares to Waze. Both have their downfalls, but google maps seems to be extremely lacking. Construction zones are never updated, while Waze is usually current due to it’s user base. My biggest complaint? Sometimes the voice guide just decides it doesn’t need to say every direction out loud, which is a problem for me. I don’t have my phone mounted and I’m usually so focused on driving that I don’t look at the screen, so I depend entirely on the voice guide. This is not fixed in any way by stopping and restarting the directions. It’s caused me to miss exits and extend my travel time.",0,
"I love google maps, hands down the best navigation tool experience. I own a small trucking company and as a driver I have tried all other navigation and nothing compares. However I’m not always able to use google maps as it doesn’t specifically route me correctly for a semi truck route. I hope one day you guys will incorporate this, I would delete all my other navigation apps that are perfunctory to say the least.",0,
"The previous version Was better. Both versions are equipped with multiple destinations. The previous version used to send me the destinations I had already been to and telling me that I had arrived at destinations I had not been yet; but this version is worse, because sometimes I can put in six or seven destinations and lose all of them at once. This version does not allow me to review and screenshot all of my destinations; whereas, the previous version did. And all of the graphics of the previous version were better looking than this version. This version is simply a step down from the previous version, and I use this app for work. I am a truck driver.",0,
"This is worse than useless, because it has replaced something that worked great. I used to search on google advanced, for something like “transmission rebuild Tigard Oregon”. Google would list a bunch of results, and if I clicked the heading that says map, it would show me a map without the results plotted on it. Now it just gives me a pop up window that asks if I meant Tigard, Oregon and insists that I either clear my search or edit it. When I edit it, it insists that I edit until it finds only one address. That’s worse than useless. I’m going to uninstall it so I can use a map that shows my search results. Google has one built right into the webpage, and it works great.",0,
"I have no idea whats been going on with Google maps lately, but recently it has been acting up. Some times the cursor would not turn when i take a turn. The cursor would even end up getting off of the direction and into a different direction out of nowhere. Or, it would just tell me to take a turn but then reroute itself. Which is why I am giving 3 star rating because it wasn’t like this way before. Started happening with the new updates. So please fix this bug issue.

"I really rely on Google Maps, but in places where I do know my way around, I wonder sometimes at the routes given.  Maybe it’s to avoid an accident though.  Many times when traveling on Interstates, we have been thankful that we were told about an alternative route around an accident.  I just wish the option to accept that route stayed on the screen longer! I also wish I could correct the voice narration of one route to my own house.   I have tried for years, with no success.",0,
I have been a dedicated google maps user for the last few years and loved the app until the recent update. I am absolutely terrible with directions and I loved the feature that allowed you to rotate the orientation of the map (once you have the path to your destination mapped out but before you actually hit start navigation) so you could align the map with the direction you were facing. For some reason they’ve removed this feature in the latest update which is super disappointing because that’s the mode I use 99% of the time when I’m walking somewhere vs. driving. Please bring it back!,0,
"This app is great for what it aims do. Its implementation is very good, and it earns very high marks for what it does. The best part is that it keeps improving, and bugs are fixed soon enough. I sometimes get ideas about making it even better; in time, they often materialize without any mention. I’ve used every GPS app in the Apple store and every GPS device you can buy on the market. You can count on the makers of Google Maps to reliably rise to the task EVERY TIME. It’s the best.",0,
I drove to Charlotte yesterday and twice I was told repeatedly that I was to go straight ahead. That was when the map showed a turn. I would follow the spoken directions only to be shouted at that I needed to u-turn as soon as possible. Several times I would follow the arrow and you guessed it: u-turn. Because of this app I did more u-turns in one day than I usually do in entire year. This was once my favorite gps app. I even paid to upgrade. Now I’m starting to wish I had saved my money. I had to leave a review when what I really wanted to do was contact them with the problem but that was not allowed.,0,
"This entire week google maps has FAILED me immensely. It 100% quit working if I didn’t have my WiFi on (I always turn it off when I leave the house for battery and security reasons) so thinking it’ll help I’ve been turning my WiFi on but still doesn’t work. I’ve never had an issue before and then Monday hits and it thinks I’m miles away from where I am, and never “reroutes” me. I use it religiously to check traffic on my commute and it’s worthless :( just last night I missed my turn 3 times because it wouldn’t update my location. On day 4 of this and it’s just awful",1,Are you still experiencing this issue on version 4.44 of Google Maps?
"Up until this version, I haven’t had any issues with the app and it is better than Apple Maps. With this version, however, the sounds are not working. I have made sure my volume is all the way up and the sounds in the app are on and still nothing. It has been an inconvenience because I found this out by missing my exit and thought I might have gone too far a few exits later. Also, the times they estimate to get to places is almost double what they should be. I don’t know what happened with this version but I hope it can be fixed soon.",0,
"I’ve always been a fan of google maps, but lately it has been giving me terrible directions. Sometimes it doesn’t talk to me at all so I don’t know when to turn, when it does talk to me, it tells me to turn here and there and they’re usually wrong like the opposite way. I am about to delete google maps of this continues. I’m afraid to reinstall since I have the latest version already and I’m sure it’s giving me wrong directions because I would test it out by putting in directions to places I already know and it has failed me many many times.",1,Thank you for your review!

"I moved house to a new town. I didn’t know how to get anywhere and at 71 and a disabled non driver I had to find my way to the Dr. Hospital and of course Walmart. Imagine my surprise when I entered my destination I found that there was a list of busses I required to get there, and back, with alternatives and a notation that read,” You need to leave now” !!! I can put in my arrival time and it tells me which bus to catch and arrive at the appointment either on time or the bus arriving before the required time. Brilliant.",0,
"Not me, the App! I live in a northeastern suburb near New York City. Occasionally, the route I’m driving appears to be confusing for the App and it just freezes in place. It will search around and not be able to function probably. This is not in the middle of nowhere either. Only 8 miles from the city. It also happens within the city, leaving me desperately in search of an option when I‘m somewhere I’m not familiar with.  The App has been updated properly, so I can’t understand what the problem is. This just started about 3 months ago, haven’t had a problem before. iPhone X.",1,"Thanks for the review. Let's give these steps a try: clear cache and uninstall the updates.

I take the bus and it takes me to the fastest bus if I’m going somewhere it will get me fast as I can with the best routes you can’t see what bus I could do in maps but google maps it gives you which to take and there is different satellites like there’s one with you can see like everything if it’s real on maps it’s just green then you could see another one with mountains and the other ones with a flat surface plz just pick this app instead of maps it worth it,0,
"It seems I can no longer get a full screen map. When first presented with this new version, I couldn’t even figure out how to use the map. Nothing would make the side bar go away, the map was grayed out and I couldn’t move or zoom the map. Took far longer than necessary to figure out it was in For You mode, which is ironic because it wasn’t showing anything relevant for me. Once back in Explore I hate that every move of the map refreshes the Explore Nearby side panel that WON’T GO AWAY. The whole point of me exploring the map is to explore the MAP, not have over 1/3 of the screen taken up up stuff that doesn’t matter to me. This is seriously so irritating I have to give a one star.",0,
"It’s a problem that I can’t adjust the correct volume setting from within the app. I’ve discovered I can change the volume while the voice is speaking by using the side buttons. Not too convenient while driving. I also discovered it’s the same volume control as when I play videos. So if I play a video and turn the volume down, but then forget to turn it back up, the google map voice goes down, too, so I have to do the whole “wait until she speaks” thing again.",0,
"I don't know if it's a bug or not, but I've faced this issue several times. When I am almost near to any destination, the map abruptly stops saying that I reached the destination way before I reach the actual destination. Sometimes the destination won't be anywhere in sight. It is very annoying in a busy traffic. I hope that next update will fix this problem. But apart from that, it is really a great app. Google maps has always been my first choice. Because of this one issue, sometimes I had to find other navigation apps.",0,
"Recently, the app has been freezing to the point where I can’t even turn the screen off. I’m talking every 30 seconds. So I have to hit the power button on the side to “sleep” my phone, wait a few seconds for it to black out, and then hit the home button and open the running app and it may or may have not “unfrozen”. This is SUPER inconvenient when I am traveling somewhere unfamiliar. I can’t be turning my frozen screen off every 30 seconds!",0,
"I have used Google Maps for years and it has proven indispensable. However, the latest version on iPhone X ios 11.2.1 crashes.  I will set my destination and route. However, when I pull the app back up as a progress in my destination the app crashes.  I need to restart the app, reset my destination and reset the route.  This is every time I return to the app. I never had this issue with previous versions of Google Maps.  I stick the phone back in my pocket or bag then pull it out when I need to reverify my progress and directions.  Not now.",0,
"i bike exclusively, so google maps is way better than apple maps. HOWEVER. i hate the fact that the location arrow icon LITERALLY NEVER POINTS STRAIGHT FORWARD. it is ALWAYS pointing 5 to 10 degrees of my direction of motion. this is a problem ive experienced for years now and cannot believe is still unfixed. the arrow points off 5-10 degrees no matter the manner of transportation either. walk, bike, drive, bus—it’s ALWAYS pointing in the wrong direction. it makes the type A in me scream for more attention to detail. google, get on this, and please give me a developer reply so i can understand and/or fix this. it deserves 3 stars for the general clutter, misaligned location icon and abundance of ugly google-pulled location-based images and general crap to navigate around. it gets 2 stars for having not fixed the arrow problem. those last two stars are for being good at biking navigation, despite all its other problems. apple maps is just cleaner and, frankly, smoother. take a page from their book.",0,
"On several occasions in the most recent app update I’ve noticed that sometimes the auditory directions won’t come on, or there is a delayed response. It’s concerning that I have to constantly check the directions on my phone while I’m driving, when this happens. Additionally, I experienced Google Maps attempting to reroute me several times while I was on a major expressway and following the directions exactly. It’s almost as though it’s struggling to track my exact location as on my move. I love Google Maps, and hope adjusts are made soon, as I much prefer it to Apple’s.",0,
"The rout option when you want the direction to the destination appears but for a second and then disappears, and sometimes it even is not showing up. Tried many things like log out and log in and changing the setting,nothing works. Edit: after an update they fixed it. Really good response in terms of this issue. Really appreciate the response from the dev. Thanks. Nearly unbeatable maps app.",1,"Thank you for letting us know about this issue, and your patience as we fixed the problem. We appreciate it! With the latest update, Google Maps should now be working as usual."
"I started a new commute and tested the three apps last year (mid 2017). There were plenty of times when I saw the same behavior simultaneously in two or all three. I attributed it to network delays or maybe a quirk in the underlying iPhone OS. After a month of comparing routes and travel times, I found Waze and Google tied for best average times and shortest routes around the Boston area, mostly during rush hour. Apple Maps was a poor third almost always.",0,
"Love Google maps. Love the one finger use, the detailed info on each location and their step by step Nav. I’ve used Apple maps and it’s all great but it feels little dry compared to Google maps. Reviews are built in without having to leave to another app just to review a place (Apple maps/Yelp 👎🏼). Only think missing from the google maps is the speed. Apple has added that and hope Google adds that soon to get a 5 star from me. Keep it up Google 👍🏼",1,"Speed limits in navigation should be available in your country!

"I thought this app could offline provide gps on downloaded maps. Works offline is a bit misleading in the description. This simply isn’t the case. It’s basically a pocket map with all the details of the downloaded area that you would get online which is awesome in every aspect. It just doesn’t walk you turn by turn like using an online data source when traveling. Worth the download? Most certainly. Great help finding stores, restaurants, etc.",0,
"Overall I like the app &amp; use it daily.  Although it’s  Very frustrating that I can no Longer set Labels to my Home/Work/School/etc.  From what I have been reading in other reviews, it appears that others have been having an issue with this as well for over a year with no correction from Google.   Very disappointing.   I was able to do this on my IPhone 6 with no issues.  Since I have installed it on my IPhone 8 it hasn’t worked correctly.  I have the latest app update, uninstalled &amp; re-installed the app, &amp; checked all settings to make sure they were enabled.",0,
The reason for my 3 star rating is I don’t understand why google maps does not show the speed limits ... a lot of other navigation apps do so except for google maps which is very surprising to me ... but I think it has best navigation routes and updates which makes it great but would be way better if only it showed the speed limit also exit numbers and lanes icons always show up small and hard to detect while driving so makes it harder to drive in silent mode ... if those 2 things get fixed this would get a 5 star rating,1,"Speed limits in navigation should be available in your country!

"I don't know what's causing it, but any time I try to use navigations anymore, I end up being unnecessarily rerouted because the app cannot keep up with my location. This is a new problem I only began noticing in the last month. Sometimes I am led to wrong turns or exits, while other times a turn I've just made isn't acknowledged, and I end up having to try and guess where to go at the last second. Is it an issue with my service area? Device? A software update? Any help would be greatly appreciated. I can't be late for work or events just because my directions didn't update fast enough.",0,
"I gave up on this app a couple weeks ago because it crashed consistently DURING NAVIGATION. After the recent update I gave it another chance but was disappointed to learn that it is still crashing DURING NAVIGATION. This is a major safety concern as most drivers will likely attempt to restart navigation while driving. The crashes seem to happen while driving in areas with poor service coverage; however one of the big benefits of Google Maps was that it used to continue to navigate even through areas with no service coverage. This seems to no longer be the case. Again I need to give up on this app until Google fixes this obvious, and major safety concern.",0,
"Everyone knows Google Maps is the best. But one thing that has me using Apple Maps more lately is the speed limit feature.

"For houses or businesses, it's great. Apartments, however, are almost always wrong.

"When I use this app while driving, and get notifications on an iPhone (external to google maps like text message notifications), the directions are covered up.

"consistently problem with this navigation, you leave, first show on the left, when you turn, it turns out it was necessary to the other side.  👿 especially enrages when it happens on the highway, when you have to go 5 miles to the nearest turn.  And the last 4 days do not work at all, and this happens every month, guys, this is not serious, do something about this !!!  Before your updates for 5 days, the navigator does not work at all, it does not show where to go at all, only along the route I can get somewhere !!!

"Ever since Alphabet bought Waze both Waze and Google maps have been getting worse and worse. I’ve used both for many years and I have great memories of them being amazing in their navigation abilities. Recently though, over the last 6 to 9 months both apps have been unable to route me to my desired destinations without making ridiculous errors. Google maps often cannot find an address that Waze can and vice versa. Also sometimes my wife and will search for the exact same address and it will come up in my Google maps but not hers or vice versa. Why is this?

"This used to be good, it’s supposed to be the pinnacle of Navigation maps but after using it for years, using to do Lyft and Grubhub it has brought me nothing but problems. The destinations in apartment complexes can be vague, so you have to hunt where you actually need to stop. It lags and updates too late, causing you to miss exits or turns. And sometimes it just takes you to the wrong freaking turn. Had to turn into Hannah Niles Way in Braintree. It told me to turn into Logan Park, BEHIND THE HOUSE I NEED TO GET TO. Customer called and was VERY angry and so was the NEXT customer because this confusion costed 10 minutes!!! Get Waze or stick to the Apple Maps instead.

"I bought two rental properties seven years ago through the home store. The properties were updated, rented out and have been managed all this time. I could not speak more highly of the home store, every aspect of the purchase, update and management process were handled professionally.

I’ve stood by google maps for years now but recently it’s been failing me terribly. It seems like location/GPS tracking is lagging now. Multiple cases have happened where I’m driving 2 steps ahead of what google maps is telling me to do. This has required me to swipe ahead to keep up with where I’m going!! It has also been a thing where it will reroute when I never committed to doing so. So when the original directions tell me I need to make a left....I’ll drive to the left lane....and next thing you know....it’ll freak out and tell me to go all the way to the right lane instead for a “faster route”. And I understand making tech personable can be a thing but omg get rid of the random “enjoy your drive” or something. It’s another stupid button to click on to get to the screen I want to see. GOOGLE MAPS TEAM. PLZ KEEP IT SIMPLE. THANK YOU. Eagerly waiting for google maps to improve to the TOP again. Until then....I’m signing up for Waze now despite the reputation of it draining battery....google maps will serve as a bookmarking tool instead.,0,

There are many routes in DC and I am sure in many other states where there are restrictions based on specific times.

"Google maps has gone crazy with turns when the shortest / fastest route is to stay on the current road. It needs to have a tolerance factor for whether making a turn is faster by more than half a minute. This afternoon it took a half minute just to recognize my location, then it tried to send me on a wild goose chase to my destination, constantly ordering turns while in a simple grid of streets and straight ahead was the most direct route. On another trip it took our carload of people through every small town and redlght between the Delaware-New Jersy bridge and Toms River, NJ. Google Maps needs to keep it simple.",0,

"Google maps is the standard, but I was sorry to see some important things missing from the CarPlay version. The best thing about Google maps is the ability to find a destination along my route.

"I refuse to use any navigation app other than GoogleMaps.

"It’s ok, but turning directions come too late to make a lane change in traffic, so u-turns are the usual way to get back on track if u-turns are allowed.  That’s ok if you don’t mind driving around in circles all day. I have to hold up the phone while I am driving to see where the next turn is because the verbal directions from the app are too late almost always.  Instead of giving a street name the voice tells you to turn right in 1000 feet.  Do I need a tape measure app too?  Like I said, it’s better than nothing, but could use some serious tweaks.",0,
"If I search for, say pizza, it gives options right around where I live. If I move the map area and select “search in this area” though, the search area does not actually expand to the new area but still only gives places close to me.

"This app is your typical navigation app, but it sometimes gets confused when you go over overpasses or detour for gas/food. If the app could identify detours, guess the reason, and navigate to a gas station/restaurant/coffee shop, it would be amazing. Even more so if it could route you to places you liked. Also, if it could guess when your car was running low and intentionally deviate so you could refuel, it would totally be a 5 star app. However, this works and it works well.",0,

This app is amazing if you have a car and need to go somewhere and you want to see the place of the location and photos of it this is the app that gives you that it’s fast and easy to use and if your lost you can just simply check on the app and type in where you need to go and it will give you the directions to go. Never be lost again and check out Google Maps!,0,
"I’ve used google maps for years and even download it on my iPhones since the iPhone maps would take me to the wrong destination and down one way roads in the wrong direction. But after the last update to this app it hasn’t basically turned into the iPhone map. It used to tell me what the next step was going to be and now it doesn’t. So if I have to take a turn right after another I won’t know until after I take the first turn which a lot of the times it won’t process fast enough that I turned. As a visual person that feature was awesome for me but without it I’m lost, literally! Lol",0,
Update: Voice directions seem to be working properly now after installing iOS 13.1.3. Back to reliable app. So much better than Apple Maps. Glad the problem is fixed!!! History(problem is now fixed). New iPhone11 w/ iOS 13. Voice directions don’t work. Initial directions when route is sterted and then silence. Makes it unusable for driving directions. Using Apple Maps instead now. Hope this gets fixed soon.,0,
The apps blue lines that “take you down the street” leads immediately to blurred picture surroundings and then to the apps crashing. It used to be my favorite app. Now I am not enjoying it. Example-&gt; One of my Facebook friends wrote about a food market/restaurant he said used only locally produced vegetables. He said the restaurant was located in a city near his farm. I Googled (Chrome) the business’s name &amp; then entered the address in Google Maps. None of the buildings at the address had the business’s name so I “dragged” my finger on the blue lines to go up the street. Everything blurred &amp; then the app crashed. Every time I try to move up the street the app crashes. Any ideas about how to fix the problem?,0,
"I listen to navigation directions over Bluetooth with my phone sitting on my seat. Consistently I will notice that I haven't heard the next step, so I pick up my phone and see that navigation is not running. Google Maps is open, just no longer in navigation mode for absolutely no apparent reason. This has persisted through multiple updates. Currently on the latest version and the issue still happens.  This is a serious flaw that must be addressed. I'll update my review and star rating if it is. Other than that, I love the app. I've always been a fan of the Google ecosystem, and I have no desire to switch to a different navigation app.",1,This is an issue we hear about from time to time. One thing that has helped some users is clearing your phone's cache and uninstalling Google Maps from your device and then reinstalling it fresh from the App Store. This will ensure you have a clean install. More details on clearing cache can be found here:https://goo.gl/GW6uOo.
"I use google maps all the time. I’m only giving it one star because it tries way too hard one one hand to save me a few tenths of a mile and a few minutes of time on the suggested route but then gives alternates that take many miles and many minutes longer. Carson City NV to Truckee CA bypasses Incline Village by directing you onto a residential street, reverse that and it takes you through town. If anything that should be opposite. Going south through Bishop CA it routes you with 5 turns through residential streets instead of staying on the main highway with a single curve.  I can’t imagine that city prefers their through traffic going down their residential streets instead of through their business district.  And that’s not even shown as an option. I have to believe these are only a few of the absurd directions offered up by google maps across the world. Yesterday it sends me to a 9’ bridge. And a one lane road. I’m 12 1/2’ tall.  50’ long. 10+ tons. You need options for avoiding low bridges. Weight restrictions. And some common sense.",0,
"There is a void in navigation software on phones and tablets. I like the app for driving my truck or car, but when towing our 5th wheel the routing can get you in real trouble as another reviewer pointed out. This would bring a new group of users to the app that are out on the road spending money that could bring in real add revenue to Google. I feel that Apple Map has moved ahead on the information displayed. Exit info is displayed earlier and more prominently. By Google still holds an advantage on local data. Add RV support!",0,
"Last update was huge. As a delivery driver, inputting multiple destinations and starting a route has been made quicker and easier. Finally the option to just go instead of having to see the preview route. Hoping future updates will have nighttime display option when you’re not in a trip, as well as a “Return” option that you can use to navigate back to your origin point! Also hoping for ability to highlight police speed traps and locations like the alternative app.",0,
1. Needs to show the speed limit! 2. Needs an Apple Watch app 3. Make the app more social like Waze where people can post if there are cops up ahead and you can get notified 4. Sometimes at crossroads it says directions too late and does not give you time to react or it says street or highway names confusingly so you aren’t sure where to go 5. It says highway and road codes like take exit 8B instead of the normal road name which is confusing. Nobody goes by these numbers. Please change this it’s confusing.,1,"Speed limits in navigation should be available in your country! Thank you for your patience as we roll this feature out. To use this feature (once it’s available to you) in the latest version of Google Maps just start driving navigation. In some locations, the maximum speed limit appears as a black and white box. In other locations, the maximum speed limit may appear as a red and white circle. You can learn more about this feature in this Google Maps Help Center article: https://support.google.com/maps/answer/3273406"
"For many purposes Googles maps has served me well.  Driving on the highway, back roads and other instances.  There is one major flaw that keeps this APP at 3 stars.  When entering a tunnel Google maps completely wigs out and becomes absolutely useless.  The marker for my vehicle starts bouncing around the screen like a pinball and the directions cannot be followed.  Waze on the other hand handles tunnels almost perfectly but has lag compared to the Actual location and causes me to miss turns on immediate turns one after the other.  Ugh having to choose between the lesser evil.",0,
"I have had the pleasure to work with Dr Rafati for over 5 years now. She is one of the most professional people I know. She truly cares about every patient in her practice and always makes them feel comfortable. She goes out of her way to ensure they are happy with their smiles at the end of their treatment. I am truly blessed to work with an orthodontist so caring,  attentive to detail and a perfectionist when it comes to helping create beautiful smiles. She has a wonderful office and I'm so blessed to be a part of it!",0,
"Historically, Google maps has been the best. Right now, usability has been diminished. The directions verse navigate button is unhelpful and doesn't add value, while leading to less intuitive navigation. The biggest issue is with mode of transportation. I will often navigate via walk or public transit, and then within the hour seem to navigate again, but now want to switch to drive mode or any different one, and I am forced to remain in the original with no clear option to fix it. The update three days ago did not improve it. If not fixed soon I will have to switch GPS",0,
However I’ve not tried to use the GPS version I do really like that it is showing businesses that I know of you been aware of in my area and then giving me links to their YouTube‘s or website now this I do enjoy however I would like to have a later to see if it actually is accurate for locating addresses on a daily basis because I am home health so I drive about 170 miles a day or more and then he direct in accurate information,0,
"If you're a map enthusiast, then this is the app for you. The user interface is easy for everyone to use, and it is very simple to understand. This app will come in very handy if you are lost on a trip. I would highly recommend this app to anyone who has to travel long distances everyday, whether that may be across the state, across the country, or even across the world. This app deserves way more than five stars, and I bet that you would agree.",0,
"I worked with Savanna Lindley in Seattle, she was wonderful to work with both professionally and personally!! We met in a coffee shop, Savanna asked what I was looking for in a headshot, then executed my needs and wishes within one hour.

I have had many compliments on my photos, everyone ask who took these photos and I say Savanna at Happy Hour Headshots!!!",0,
"Caused an embarrassing and frustrating 15 minute detour unintentionally into Washington DC when the map kept spinning and changing the navigation guidance. I didn’t make any turns - the map shouldn’t “predict” that I will swerve to make a left 0.1 seconds after it decided I should, and then spins right 0.2 seconds after deciding I missed the left and now time to make a left. Only when I went straight (because I’m not about to cause a wreck) onto the bridge did the map stop spinning trying to predict my turns. Also, literally up to 15 minutes ago I was able to use the “arrive by” feature - now it’s just set a reminder. I need the feature back - how did it disappear?",0,
"Most of the time, this app works great! But sometimes, I’ll type in an address and it just says it can’t find the location! I like in a pretty urban place too, the DMV area. Just a quick note, when it google maps doesn’t work, I’ll resort to Apple maps which can find the destination without any issue. When google maps succeeds at finding the destination I type in, I’d give this app 10 stars bc I love the UI. When it can’t find places, nothing seems to work, I’ll refresh, close the app and reopen but still nothing. That gets frustrating.",0,
I love it I use it all the time. Nick name it Cheryl so I can yell at it when I get mad. I would to love to see added feature for business. I’m not sure if it’s in there but I just haven’t seen it. You can close a business permanently but some business close for the season. You know season stuff ice cream places etc. you should add in close temporarily or for the season. That way the business can do that. I’m not sure if the owner has to do that but you should add it.,0,
"Google Maps does not recognize express lanes namely the 110 and 10 fwy ones here in Los Angeles and keeps trying to re-route when someone enters the toll lanes. Please fix this. During Pasadena Rosebowl events, maps get screwed up and at the interchange where the 134 and 210 west / east converge, maps point an arrow and tell you to take the long beach fwy without explaining which direction of travel or which fwy name to take until its too late. A detour can be pretty big time buster. For someone new to navigation, kindly change the maps from saying take exit for california historic route 2 and change it back to santa monica blvd like it used to be. For the 110 fwy near USC, kindly change the map from saying exit colliseum and change it back to saying exit Martin Luther King Jr. Blvd. In addition to the speed limit overlay, please also put the current speed overlaid on it.",0,
"Love Google Maps &amp; have used it for a long time. My only complaint is the new window that opens when you select a destination &amp; hit Start. Instead of just starting the directions, it opens detailed view window of the route. I’ve tried just hitting the Start button but 9/10 times it opens the detailed view. Wish they’d change it back or put the detailed view open option further away from the Start button.",0,
"Our ice-maker in our Samsung refrigerator was broken and leaking. We were referred by the Nextdoor Neighbor App to Jim at Music City Home Services. Jim was very responsive, friendly, and even fixed our ice-maker after 5pm on his birthday!! He was efficient, neat, and went above and beyond! The ice-maker is working great, less than 2 days after our call. I highly recommend Music City Home Services! We are pleased!! They also do plumbing and electrical work which we will use when needed.",0,
"Bring back the old logo. Next, the auto location button is too close to the body of the map, which causes one who is panning and navigating with their fingers to accidentally tap that, which is like having someone come over and crumble up their map as they are working on something. I suggest moving that button underneath the “x” on the search box so that it’s out of the way and still reachable for when you want to auto locate your current position .",0,
"Google maps has been my go to for navigation for many years now, recently they changed the look making it harder to differentiate streets from the blocks and taking away the NYC subway stations from the transit map (not the stops but the actual layout of the station). This makes the map less functional. I’ll still use it for some things but will have to rely on other apps for things that this one used to do, like walking directions or subway trips. Still a good app but no longer the best option for iPhone.",0,
I called yesterday last morning and got an appt for 3:30. I was registered and called within about  5 minutes. Everyone were professional and expeditious but caring in their manners.

The accent is even weird to me, a Nigerian. She doesn’t pronounce anything right and that voice sounds so uninspiring I might sleep off on a trip. Also, I can’t seem to fix the problem by changing it to my previous setting which was the American voice. I’m not even in Nigeria and have deleted the app several times to try and correct it but it’s not working. I’m just going to stop using it totally.",0,

I rely on google maps to get me everywhere almost daily as I’m part of a military family and am constantly moving from state to state I just get to learning where I’m going and then it’s time to move again. I used to love google maps no I spend more time cursing it then ever before I’ll be driving straight down the road the way I need to go and all of a sudden it’s rerouted and tells me to turn around I turn around and bam it tells me to turn around again it never seems to know which way I’m traveling anymore it’s about time to pull out the garmen again or find a better app,0,
"Mostly love this app, but it's beyond irritating that the exit number doesn't show up until the last mile. For example, if I'm on a highway and I want to know whether it's going to tell me to take exit 21 or 18 (because I know both are options), but it just says ""89 miles to route 27,"" this is useless! And there's obviously room for it because it does show up at the end. Why not let us have advanced warning? I don't know the numbers of the tiny state and city routes, and I need more than miles to plan ahead. Don't be so stingy with exit numbers! So frustrating.",0,
"This app doesn’t work properly. I went on my laptop to set up a specific route to get to my destination, and I had to drag the blue pins and set it up which took me a long time to do. I can’t drive on the highway due to my car, so I have to take road ways even avoiding hills as well. So google maps on my laptop helps me find another route, but when I tried to send the directions to my cell phone so the Bluetooth can read the directions while I’m driving, it sends the link but it opens the app and gives me a completely different way to drive. Like what happened to my original route that took me forever to set up on my laptop. I don’t understand why it won’t work in the app.",0,
"I have used GM for the last 7-8 years. Accurate, fast and intuitive in all aspects of navigation. I have a 2005 Dodge RAM truck, with Google Maps it becomes my Bentley on the road. Thanks Google that makes a great solution. One thing I would like to see is printing a map of my journey for my business reports and customer portfolio’s. I don’t want all the directions just a clear map to and from my location to theirs I can easily print. Thanks. Bob",0,
"This app was so important to me and my main app. I’m always going somewhere new and far and the past few months it freezes every time, I’ve had to stop using it. I kept getting halfway to a location in the dark on unfamiliar highways and it just stop. It’s useless to me like this. I can’t sit there and read the directions while driving alone. That’s why I got the app in the first place!! I’ve been late to school functions, a job interview and a doctors appointment before giving up on this app. I’ve deleted and redownloaded it because that’s what you’re supposed to do when apps stop working, but not even the latest update and a fresh download make it functional again.",0,
"I love Google maps, it’s the best app period of course nothing is perfect. It can be off on some of the brand new streets but it still finds them where other apps won’t. The only reason it doesn’t get a 5 is because it freezes. Google you have to fix that! I used it for years never did that until the last update. When you type in your address and try to hit start, I’m hitting start 4-6 times because the app freezes. But for that it would get a 5. I’d give it a 4 1/2 if I could.",0,
"I use it all the time because the GPS in my car is out if date and no update is available. Occasionally I use it locally to see how it well it does sending me the ways I know work. For these tests it averages a B+, which I also have to assign by default to the directions for longer trips as well. Changing the subject, what they could do to set themselves apart from all the others would be to write a subroutine that would allow us to divide longer trips by miles or hours to be driven in a single day.",0,
"I have been having issues with this app for months now. When I try to get directions google maps will place me in random locations nowhere near my actual location, give me directions that aren’t relevant to my trip and sends me out of my way to gas stations that don’t exist. Currently I’m stranded with no gas because of this app. I am extremely disappointed in the unreliability of this app, especially when reliability is everything for a gps/map application. It would be much safer and more efficient for me to get lost without this app, instead of it constantly losing my location and sending me to gas stations that don’t exist. THANK YOU GOOGLE DEVELOPERS.",0,
"Starting a few updates back, regardless of how I set the “Always keep map North Up” setting, the map defaults to North Up every single time and I have to touch the arrow button to make it show the “ahead of me” view that I want as default. Also give us an option to set the zoom level we prefer out and still have the maps follow us. My view is too close and I’d like to see a little further beyond the map display but as soon as I zoom out a tick, the map stops following me and I have to “re-center”.",0,
"The Google Maps app enables literally anyone with an internet connection, AND this app, to see extensive details of any given spot on the Earth in essentially real-time. It shows local topography, present (typical?) vegetation, many current nearby structures, and actual (at least relative) distances and directions to various (any) nearby well-known landmark(s). It can also show the GPS coordinates of any given point of interest by “dropping a pin” at that spot.",0,
"I love the app mainly but I wish you could stop with the whole “Similar ETA” thing, I’d rather know if it’s just one minute faster or slower to choose the alternate route instead of choosing the other route and then having to click back to the previous route if it’s a lot longer. You would make the app even more hands free if people just have to glance down to see the options available when other routes show up",0,
"Glad to see google maps is now available through CarPlay. Works well for the most part and I haven’t come across any glaring issues. I’ve noticed two things so far, the first is that the traffic lines are always on and I prefer to turn the traffic lines off to have a cleaner look while driving. Second, scrolling across the screen while navigating is jittery and doesn’t move smoothly or at all sometimes. Fix those two things and it’s definitely five stars.",0,
"Honestly...it’s from Google and it helps you figure out where you’re going next! With memory of places where you’ve been and reviews from others to your next destination, how can you go wrong? Sure it’s not 100% but I would call 97% with potential suggested edits a true app that continues to withstand the test of time. Having the ability to personalize your locale in categories and mark them is just one of the many features.",0,
"This app is by far the best, but I really wish that you could set it to show nearest locations first. When I want to go to a grocery store I don’t care that there’s a more popular store 50 miles away. I often have to type in the name of the town I’m in to sort through which one is the closest, when I feel like that should be a super easy thing to calculate, considering the app is already calculating it from my current location.",0,
"We have been dining at Lulu every week for a few months now. It is in Greenwich with the best quality and best authentically prepared Chinese food compared with the finest restaurant chefs in NYC. The Peking Duck is superb as are so many other dishes that we feel like we would be naming dozens on the menu, since we are such loyal customers. The communal tables are comfortable in this classy restaurant that judging by all seats filled has become a very popular dining spot. Thank you Jody Pennette for opening our favorite restaurant.",0,
Google maps works well enough for driving but I much prefer it’s Google owned  sister app Waze for driving navigation. However I use this app heavily for searching businesses or venues - which is a god send. When We were traveling in the Alps this app was not only a God send to find eating establishments which accurately indicated their hours and if they were even open in the tourist dead season! Also navigating the highways etc including tolls in Europe was easy with this app. Beats staring at maps all the time!,0,
"Anything is better than apple maps.  Has Apple maps improved Since the days of Scott Forestall, yes but it is still nowhere near the capabilities of Google Maps and the fact that apple defaults to Apple Maps for everything even after deleting it from the iPhone is abysmal.

"Leaving a Freeway/Tollway Gmaps doesn’t always show the existing exit numbers and uses an exit road name not on any sign the highway system uses!! WT@! Turn instructions at times pop up late, in the middle of the turn leaving no time to react. Addresses are no longer shown at the end of the journey making it difficult especially in business districts. Past history sometimes vanishes making traveling more difficult. I’ve submitted reports to G maps showing the exit #, the exit road name, the panic of late info and lack of addresses with no resolve three updates later.

"I'm using iPhone 6s Plus with iOS 10.3.3, the compass works fine and is able to show the right direction I'm facing in normal mode until I start navigating. In the navigation mode the arrow keeps pointing to the wrong direction, and when I turned it into the compass mode, the whole map start spinning every second even if I don't move at all. I couldn't tell the right direction because the map is spinning like crazy, which makes the navigation function useless. (And the voice says ""head to the north,"" but how am I supposed to know where north is?) I tried to recalibrate the compass by the ""figure 8"" method but to no avail. Please fix this problem as soon as possible!",0,
"Love the traffic and how well the app corrects based on fastest routes and what not. But when I’m driving to an address, before I actually arrive it will say “you have arrived” sometimes when I’m even a quarter-mile away and still need to turn onto another street which is incredibly frustrating and leaves me guessing sometimes because the map no longer orients to the direction I’m facing relative to a compass.

"impressive, should be apple's default map instead of their own apple maps app like ios 5. Miss those good old days where google maps was automatically built into your iphone.

Also, when I do have Wi-Fi I I pre-route my destination and it still has my route despite the fact that I leave my area that has Wi-Fi. It’s also cool that you could pre-download locations so that we could use maps online offline. Currently I am in Japan and it helps a lot.",0,

Thank you google team, keep up the good work and keep us updated. Thank you again",0,
Love it so much. Love the new icon. I hope the next update will be able to let you switch voices like Siri ( male or female ) and that some kind of way it will give you a map that shows you where you parked at once you exit your vehicle with a notification of where you parked and once you are ready to return to your vehicle you just tap the notification and it opens a map to your parking location and directs you to your vehicle.... That would be so cool !!!,0,
"This app works amazing, like you would expect a mapping program to work but I have found that when freeways or highways get shut down, and there’s nobody on that section of highway, it will route you to it, thinking it is clear of traffic. So a couple nights ago, it routed me into an area with 2 feet of snow and closed freeways. I thought that it was being plowed and was still open but no. Not sure what the fix is but better communication with local highway or law enforcement to update road closure information, would be awesome",0,
Observing for last several months. The directions are through specific roads only and doesn’t show the traffic on or options to select other roads. This is kind of manipulating which road to take according to Google maps instead of showing traffic on other roads as well. Especially between Cupertino and Levi’s Stadium in Santa Clara or between Cupertino and Fremont and back on any given day at any given time. Walking maps are horrible with GPS not clear about which direction I am facing. Apple Maps is getting better than Google maps now. I don’t trust Google traffic and directions anymore since they are getting incorrect every month.,0,
"I’ve used the google maps app for a long time and rarely had any issues, but today it was a complete mess. I was driving downtown in San Francisco when the app asked if I wanted to use some new feature that is supposed to show me where to go and requires the use of my phones camera (red flag!). I dismissed it and didn’t allow it to access my camera, but then the whole app glitched! It didn’t know where I was, or what direction I was going, and kept telling me to turn left on market street (which is not possible). I finally shut it off, pulled over, and downloaded Apple maps just so I could get home. Whatever that new feature is, it’s ruined the app.",0,
"Every morning I check out a preview of my morning commute by entering my destination and then click “directions”. It used to show the preview with all the traffic spots which helped me plan my drive. It now shows the traffic on the start of my route but no traffic further down the route (even though it’s there!) When I take the route off the map I can see the traffic further down the road.  I’m going to have to go back to AppleMaps until this is fixed. C’mon Google, why did you change this?",0,
"So I been using google maps for years and have mostly been happy with its functionality. But lately it’s been rather annoying where just like other people mentioned it has been freezing up. Another problem is it’s street view which has become totally unusable. Again like others have mentioned its interface is bad, navigating is hard and it freezes up and the view is often blurry because of loading issues. It’s become useless to use and I have since stopped trying to use it. I think Google needs to redo the entire app and hopefully get it working right.",0,
Every mom at some point dreads the thought of head lice. I experienced that today when I found lice in my daughter’s hair.

"Google Maps used to work great on my iPhone 6s, and when I switched to an iPhone X earlier this year, things changed. Sometimes it shows me being in the middle of no where instead of the main highway I’m on, or will stop giving directions in an area that has perfect reception. There have been many times where I’m trying to do field work at a farm and the blue dot will not move even when I’m trying to find the field I need to go to. Like I said, it worked great on my 6s and not on my X. Please fix or I will stop using your app. There is no reason why it shouldn’t work on the X when it works on other iPhone models.",0,
"I’ve noticed this some weekends now- gmaps seems to be giving subway directions based on changed track information. The problem is it is almost always inaccurate. For instance, to go into Manhattan from Brooklyn it is telling me my usual line is not stopping at my station, when it is in fact. It’s possible the MTA info they are pulling from is off. In the past, it would show the default directions then have a notification about changed track routes. I prefer this because it allows me to make a decision on my own. Until they iron out the quirks they should show the true directions. It’s being too clever and failing its users.",0,
Google Maps works and works well for complicated inter-urban driving making for many successful trips in the hectic daily schedule that requires my time. The voice activation on my cellphone is great and helps in route changes and muti-tasking. Traffic updates and alerts gives smart routing an active role in congested navigation and is a necessity for modern mobility. If you live and drive in large cities then you need Google Maps. Good Luck and Safe Driving.,0,
"I choose google maps always for my GPS needs because I find it the most reliable. But I do wish you can control the volume of the GPS when you’re in the app at anytime. Unfortunately, the only way to adjust the volume is if the navigation is speaking. So I find myself rushing to increase the volume before it stops speaking. It’s ridiculous. Other than that, google map all the way! With this minor improvement, it will be a superb navigation app!",0,
"This works well however, over just the last week, a Major bug caused all my saved places to go away....Very bad! I used this to save all my good places I have been and want to go.  Some “upgrade” caused them to go away and text to the Google help has been slow for a fix. On the good side, when you send in a suggested fix to an error that you may find (and note this can be due to another user input of crap data) they are fast to fix it. Wish, I could save routes I plan for trips like other map programs....I know I can send to a phone but why not just name a trip like a place in the program so I can call it up on what ever device I wish? Last funny thing, I moved to  new house and GPS data is for the most part, spot on, well, the new house does seem to be about 200’ off all the time.  When I drive around, I’m right on target, it is like the map is distorted in this neck of the woods.",1,"Thank you for your patience as we worked on this problem. With the latest app release, this issue should now be resolved, and your saved locations should once again be visible. Please ensure your Map is up to date with this Google Maps Help Center link: https://support.google.com/maps/answer/3615175?co=GENIE.Platform%3DiOS&amp;oco=0. We appreciate your patience while this investigated and please let us know if you continue to have issues with your saved places."
App overall is great- no complaints and I know there is frequent updates so thats why I’m bringing this idea. I’m a person that enjoys road tripping. It would be great to map and save your route. Could be able to name it different things... be able to save different routes for different trips... and for it to only pop up when you select that route.. What do you think? Possible? Would be helpful for all adventures out there 🌲🗺,0,
"For years I tried to do without the added expense of internet access on my mobile phone. What was I thinking? Google Maps is a necessary time saver Time is money! Seamless navigation avoids traffic jams and suggests alternate routes. I've probably wasted a years worth of time trying to navigate on the go without this app. Never again will I subject myself to such stress, extra fuel usage , and time better spent anywhere other than sitting in traffic.",1,Thank you for your review! We appreciate it and are pleased to hear you are enjoying Google Maps!
"I would like google map not to make decisions or change decisions based on traffic information. Often, the decisions made by google are very bad. It is nice to show traffic and warnings about upcoming traffic situation. Let me make a decision. In most cases, I have found that google map decisions based on traffic have caused longer time than decisions based on no traffic information. The traffic information is nice to have and only more accurate when I am approaching traffic jams. For mediate to long trips, google map decisions are pretty useless to harmful. I have to stop using google maps for that reason. The one Star is to credit easy usage of app itself.",0,
This is a wonderful map application in the world is very helpful for everyone every day use it when driving on road staying in somewhere in the world finding the way to somewhere they want. I love this application much more anything else. It can book mark remark somewhere that I love that I want to go back is very easy to fight it on the map thank you very much Google map I wish you do much more better and better.,0,
"Google maps used to be my favorite for navigation and exploring new towns and countries. But lately i have no idea whats going on but its been glitchy. It crashes every time I try to get directions from my location to any place. I literally have to go on my desktop and then send the direction to my phone. Sometimes it takes hours to locate me. And on a few occasions I would search for a thing (i.e spa, supermarket,...) get directions go there and find out the place is in a whole different city. Like how? Why? Just downloaded Waze 🙁",0,
"This company has been such a great help. We purchased back in December 2017 a vehicle that wasn’t working out for us, so they let us trade it in for something else, then there was a minor mechanical fix on the vehicle they were willing to get fixed in their shop for free! Great people at this business and they treat you like family. Definitely recommend and if anything goes wrong with the vehicle you purchase, they are always there to help you out.",0,
"The latest version seems to lock up my iPad. I need to press the home and the power buttons at the same time to force the iPad to restart and this has happened a few times. Very annoying. That, plus the always hated blue line in street view, makes me move to Apple’s Maps app more often now. Google’s Maps still has some features that Apple’s Maps doesn’t, so I still use it from time to time. But I find myself in Apple’s app much more often now. I particularly prefer Apple’s “Look Around” feature (without a blue line that spins you around). Luckily, Apple already covers a city I frequent.",0,
"I have used this app a number of times in the last couple months to help me navigate roads and each time I use it I have experienced major mistakes. Two examples are when I was driving in a city, it tried to send me in the wrong direction on a one way road.  Another example is when I put in my destination address and it took me on a different side road, then a loop around a neighborhood on that side road, then back to the main road to go to the destination. The side road and loop had nothing to do with getting to the destination. Hopefully these bugs can be fixed because as it is, the app is the least helpful navigation system I have ever used.",0,
"I am really disappointed in Google Reviews. I left a one star review for Charlie’s Dodge in Toledo, Ohio because my partner had a situation with them that I felt needed to be shared. The “owner” comments suggested that my name couldn’t be found anywhere in their database so I MUST be mistaken. Next thing I know, my review and rating disappears from viewing. I can see it on my end in my profile on Google Maps as if it’s there. But I’ve continued to check live google, and sorted it every which way but it’s gone. I mean what’s the point of leaving feedback if the owner can just snap their fingers to disappear reviews they don’t like? That is not worth my energy. And quite simply, it is disgusting.",0,
"I rely on using a GPS every day and Google Maps was my favorite one. Unfortunately a new update changed how the navigation looks when traveling for no apparent reason. Now rather than having a stationary icon at the bottom center the car moves on a stationary map, this means the map doesn’t reorient itself automatically so that it’s always facing forwards. This makes it a lot more difficult while navigating and makes it so I have to manually reorient the map with my fingers while driving. I emailed them about this and they never got back so I’m writing this review. I hope they fix this, don’t ‘fix’ what isn’t broken.",0,
"I used to have no problems whatsoever with this app but it has gotten worse and worse for who knows what reason! I used to be able to click on the “directions” button when looking up someplace on google and it would automatically go to the god app and all I had to do was click the “start” button. However, the passed few weeks I’ve had to do two more steps to get to the gps and now when I click on the “directions” button it takes me to the gps app and then LOSES the route info!! So now I have to memorize or write down the address and manually type it into the gps...so now the “directions” button is useless.",1,"Thanks for your review!

"I use Google in a professional capacity. And something I’ve noticed lately is how Google maps has lost its once stellar luster. I can be looking at a planned route and see the traffic congestion. At the same time, be on the phone with someone in the same area as the planned route and get a conflicting report. I know Google has tuned their algorithm on the search engine to skew results to support some hidden agenda. Has the same happened to their maps? I dunno. All I know is, I’ll probably be getting a Garmin. This app isn’t near as handy and accurate as it once was.",0,
"I noticed this last update changed the way the map looks, previously I was able to see little squares that represent houses on the map when I would plug in a destination the pin would fall on one of the squares which made it very easy to find a house now they have taken away the squares and it just drops the pin but I can’t see the house it’s on so as a delivery man it’s harder to locate the houses I’m delivering too, also I noticed that the google street view controls and gestures have changed again making it harder to locate a house I have to deliver to",0,
"I doubt anyone at google ever has to take a bus or they would not have traded their soul to Uber and Lyft and taken away the most important feature on the bus routes — multiple routes and times to choose from. Suddenly you only get one choice which leaves a lot of room for the driving apps filling the screen to make them more money, because we all know they really need more money. I have never liked Apple Maps, but I was forced to use it over this bus issue and was pleasantly surprised that they offered endless route and time choices. I would give this app five stars if they change back to the way it was when they thought about people first and not money.",0,
"Just recently I have had a lot of trouble getting Google maps to open. Upon opening, it will stay on for 2 to 30 seconds and then shut down. Most of the time, I can’t even get the first two or three letters of my destination typed. This is very frustrating. I have also had it quit after I have been driving for a few minutes. I look at my iPhone and it is black. This has been happening for about two weeks. I thought the last update would fix it but it didn’t. I have had this app for years and never had a problem. I also love the easy intuitive search engine. However, if it won’t stay on, I can’t use it. Help.",1,Sorry to hear about this issue! Can you please try these troubleshooting steps to see if they fix the problem? - Try restarting your device - Try uninstalling/reinstalling Google Maps fresh from the App Store
"I have a love-hate relationship with Maps. It is usually reliable, but sometimes provides less than optimum routes. Specifically, on the highway, it sometimes tells you to exit to surface streets, which sometimes might be faster. But it only takes one or two red lights or left turns to make the route slower. I’d really like to see a change in the algorithm so it doesn’t give you a “faster route” unless that route will save at least 10 minutes, at least when on major roads and highways. Also, offline maps don’t really work. I’ve tried to use downloaded maps several times, and although I can view the maps, routing doesn’t work. It always says “no connection”. Also, what’ happened to Apple Watch support? Maps has been on, then off, the Apple Watch several times. Please bring it back!",0,
"It gets me where I need to go for the most part but sometimes it takes me through weird ways. It’s annoying when I want to give feedback on the route but the current route doesn’t accurately take me to the destination, so I can never give feedback because the feedback only comes at the end after your arrive. I hope that made sense. But this navigation system is better than iPhone imo because it keeps up with real time and iPhone’s Maps feels laggy.",0,
"I use this App to catch the bus. First of all when you initially put in your destination they don’t give you the correct departure time. For instance if I leave work at 9pm, it will give me bus routes for tomorrow morning at 4 am. Second, they never really give you the best route to take until the last minute and then they’ll tell you a quicker bus is coming the moment you’ve slew gotten on the other bus. If your using the App to walk a certain distance this I terrible too. It’s hard to navigate since the blue dotted lines aren’t lined up correctly and then they will have you going a completely different direction. This App isn’t really reliable at all.",0,
"This recent update has gotten all the exits wrong. It tells me my next exit is on my right when it’s actually on the left and vice versa. And when it’s actually right on which direction my exit is it turns out there’s another problem, it tells me which exit I’m taking but doesn’t let me know that I actually have to change freeways. This added me at least another 30 min to my trip before I realized what was going on. This app has many great features but it has given me so many problems even before the update.",0,
"For the better part, does a good job of getting you close to your destination. However, once you get within two blocks of your destination, the app says you have arrived, and does NOT show the address. It shows you latitude and longitude, which doesn’t help you when you’re driving and may not be able to use your hands to pull up the address. Also, would be wonderful if the app could direct you to a cross street that has a signal light, rather than trying to dodge traffic to get to the other side of the street.",1,Thank you for your review!

Map seems to have developed a mind of its own and controls what portion of your trip you can see.  I find it frustrating how it routs you through tangled neighborhoods when you know shorter straighter ways!  It now shows way too much advertising - which I would like the option of turning off!  When you try to enlarge part of the map - it springs away from you - and worst of all - takes away the recentering arrow which would have allowed you to continue the route. I take that back!  Worst of all -  I’m now wondering why I can’t get the map to sync to my  Contacts database!  Hate this map!  Give me the options of what I want and need - or get out of my life!,0,
"First I updated the app, my first mistake, then I entered a route with 8 stops, that I Used to be able to view on the map, and rearrange them into a reasonable route. When I discovered the app has been ‘improved’, I went to the App Store to look for a how-to, and noticed another update , thinking Aha! They’ve “improved” it yet again! I updated it again, which wiped out my route. I entered the route again, and all I see now is a spaghetti shaped route with no apparent way to reorder the stops...geez! Stop with all the improvements already! Maybe I’m missing something, but it isn’t hard to do when you keep making fundamental changes to the interface.",0,
"Firstly after trying several places, I landed here to just be in the right place at the right time. Nice people to deal with, I loved the exchange quote on my old car, very minor faux calculations, Yes! I dint say none, but varying market makes them do. Now coming to the car, delivery was late than expected but I reasoned that to real time issues. The celebrations at the delivery time the ‘better than rest’ fair trade and lastly their efforts to attend to customer have been top notch!",0,
I moved to a new city and have found it very difficult to figure out because the streets all have multiple names and when you call employees at businesses they can’t tell you the address! ( crazy ) or if you have the address; they can’t help you find it! Without the map program I would have most likely been in a different state by now. A different map program has sent me on wild goose chases three times in a row! Thanks,0,
"Great App guys. Have been using it for years. Also like the new For You section as I’m always looking for new places. However, you guys bought WAZE, so when are you going to integrate wreck information with Google Maps? Right now you do show the car accident, but you don’t show the time it was originally reported like WAZE does.  That’s hugely helpful for determining when it might let up and when to avoid. Put that in your backlog. Thanks!",0,
"Google maps has redirected my route to somewhere completely different numerous times, often after I miss a turn and it seems to trigger some error in the system.  Then, the other day I was navigating on the highway and the Google maps app decided that was the perfect time to pop up some box asking about updating the app, at that VERY MOMENT, while in the midst of using the app to navigate somewhere. I couldn’t read the buttons for the potential responses while driving, and it wouldn’t show me my map of where I was going until I dismissed the message box. Whose bright idea was this??  There are MUCH better apps out there for finding your way.",0,

"My daughter was married at Devil’s Thumb Ranch near Winter Park Colorado last weekend. Our favorite vendor was our florists. It was a large wedding needing flowers at different sites for two days at the ranch. Mindy, Becky, and their staff exceeded all our expectations- the flowers were spectacular- From the wedding arch to the bouquets to the reception flowers- especially the wreath rings of greenery, lights and flowers hanging from the rafters above. As important as the flowers, they were great in communicating and really made an effort to listen to our vision.",0,
"Lately there’s been a thing where the route I select automatically changes without my permission, which throws off my travel schedule. Fix it. Please! I’ll select the longer timed route to work with less mileage(plan a), and if I start running late the idea is that I can deselect that option and go for the “normal” timed, more mileage route to work(plan b). However sometimes at some point after selecting the longer timed route(plan a),  I’ll go to select the secondary one, only to discover the app already changed the route to that one, and I’ve been going off the ETA of the secondary (plan b) route. (Insert inappropriate scream) Which means I am actually late to my job, with no plan b to work. This has happened more times than is acceptable for a map app. Please give an option to prevent the app from making decisions to switch the route previously chosen. I have scoured the app and no longer see any option to do so. My paycheck and my sanity will thank you.",0,
"I love google maps. That being said there are a few features that would help. Please add a pause button. When traveling I don’t want my phone telling me directions while at a restaurant or at a rest stop. Please add a feature that would eliminate roads that are inappropriate for a travel trailer or RV. Went over Teton pass today and would have rather taken an alternate route. Along with traffic alerts, wind alerts would be helpful. Thank you so much for your consideration.",0,
"We were on the greek island of skopelos, using google maps and trying to go to the mamma mia church and this dang app led us to this super narrow dirt road, if you can even call it a road!!! We couldn’t even u turn because it was so narrow and not to mention we were really high up in the mountains, death right by the side of the car. After we survived, I routed the church on the regular maps app that come with the iPhone and it leads you through the main roads, unlike this god forsaken app!!! The roads we followed on google maps weren’t even on the iPhone maps app smh!!! Anyways since google maps is trying so hard to murder us, you best BELIEVE that I will be using the og maps app.",0,
"I see a few other reviewers having the same problem. There are tons of locations glitches, where the app says I’m somewhere I’m not and gives weird directions accordingly. Today, the app straight up crashed while I was on the freeway on the way to the gas station without any notice. I ended up overshooting by several miles (while low on gas) when I realized  and had to drive around in an unfamiliar city looking for a gas station. This is a safety hazard and I feel that developers should have withheld the iPhone X compatibility update if it wasn’t really ready.

"If you do not have this app on your iOS device you subject yourself to a life of inconvenience. Google has intentionally made it as painful as they could to use their products on non-Google devices. Any time you search for directions online, Google does not allow you to copy them — instead making you copy the Google Maps link.

We have just moved to a new part of town and I depend on it constantly. Its a good partner but sometimes it’s slow to change the turn arrow that reflects the next turn or proper lane - which can be either frustrating or downright dangerous.

And I do love the feature that tells you if a business is open or closed at the time of your expected arrival.,0,

Google Maps navigation in comparison to Waze and TomTom apps is just utter rubbish. It either tells you too tern too early or too late and it often recalculates for no reason when it thinks for a second that you’ve gone a different way. I’m on the road all day everyday and whenever I use Google Maps navigation in CarPlay I’m always missing turns or having to pay extra attention to the map and route on screen because it never knows when the right time is to speak the necessary information. When I use the Waze or TomTom apps for navigation in CarPlay I never have this problem. I’d recommend to the developer to go use Waze navigation and Google Maps navigation side by side on roads that you don’t know and you’ll see which one works better. The new icon is fine.... but what we all really want in Dark Mode support.... so get on that...,0,

I had 3 options &amp; chose my normal route which was 30 min longer but that is what I am comfortable with... As I was driving... it found me quicker route &amp; asked me if I wanted to accept...

"I drive close to 150 miles a day and switch between Waze and Google Maps. 1. Google maps needs to give more route options when on side roads and not just main roads and highways. 2. Google maps is very glitchy as it loads the surrounding maps during navigation, this causes large white squares to briefly appear. It’s does not hinder the navigational view but is very annoying. 3. On major highways the app assumes it’s one lane, when I have been in up to 6 lanes and miss the exit because my city exits off right and left side. —This also applies to interchanges and divides, it’s unsafe when you guess which lane until the last moment. 4. Give us the speed limit! Every other app it feels like shows the speed limit besides google, it’s stupid beneficial, enough said. 5.

"Recent versions have introduced significantly worse routing instructions that can quite often show disconnects between turn arrows and actual upcoming maneuvers. A right turn may be the next maneuver, but the turn arrow and text instructions show the previous maneuver (a left turn, for instance) without having updated after that maneuver was completed. In many recent situations, I’ve been told to turn one way while the route itself goes a different direction. As a daily user for years, this never happened prior to the last couple months.",0,

There were no stores or businesses I could stop at to ask directions when finally the voice on Google maps said, “I don’t know where you are” and turned off leaving me in the middle of nowhere and not knowing how to get back on a main road.

"It use to be a valuable GPS tool, and it outperformed Apple’s maps. But over the last twelve months or so, it suffers in its ability to perform as it once did. - many 180 degree flips when progressing along your route. At one point it showed my car driving backwards for a long while before it fixed itself. - many awkward routes to my destinations. I can often use common sense to reduce time significantly or save myself time by avoiding a left turn at a busy uncontrolled intersection suggested by Google Maps. And no, I don’t have avoid tolls or highways activated. - difficult to turn off satellite view once activated - it asks inappropriate questions during navigation like “May Google Maps have access to your microphone?” Seems to be intentional so most users select OK to dismiss the question obscuring the view. - hangs more often now.

Otherwise, I like this app a lot and love how it detects traffic so quickly and identifies alternate routes.",0,
I use Google Maps to quickly look at traffic in my area before heading out. The new update moved the Layers to a button and it does not save the Traffic option.

I am recovering from binge-eating disorder and find the new calorie count with walks disturbing. Especially since there is no option to disable it. The new ""feature"" which gives me no option but to see a (probably highly inaccurate) average calorie burn estimate when I want to walk somewhere is incredibly dangerous to those suffering from eating disorders/disordered eating, and underage users who are more vulnerable. Whoever thought it was a good idea clearly wasn't thinking that they could be harming a significant portion of the population and putting so many people at risk. Probably highly inaccurate at best, capable of contributing to someone's death at worst. This is not a helpful feature. PLEASE: - Consider removing it now that you've been made aware it's putting vulnerable people at risk - If you must keep it, have it as an option that the user must elect to turn on in a menu, not as default",0,
"In addition to my previous rating below, the newest version now will not let me access previous addresses that I have navigated to loner than 2 weeks ago. There are very tiny words which say, ”From your search history on this device,” but when you tap on it the words are dead - in other words, nothing happens. Due to this I have lost LOTS  of important destination addresses. Very frustrating. Sad to say, the more updates the less accurate this app becomes. Some recent disappointments since the previous update: 1. When I approach a red light for a turn, it tells me the next turn before I’m even on the road that I should have turned on 2. Today I used it to get to a trailhead for a hike; it got me to the parking lot fine, but then directed me out of the parking lot for an endless loop. I’d attach a screen shot from the app, but there isn’t a way for me to do that here. The directions of this app have become ridiculous.",0,
"Things change all the time. So are business addresses, and their existence. That is, they sometimes move and unfortunately some go out of business. Google maps and the street view feature has not kept up to these changes. However, I noticed that Apple Map has... to a point. Hopefully, Google will once again get back into updating the map. Especially when they’re creating driverless vehicles. Imagine getting to a destination that no longer exist in the address you selected on the map!",0,
"I prefer Waze but bc I have to take preplanned multi-stop trips for work, I can’t use it. When I open Maps, I usually only see a Preview button for my route and there is no way to actually start the directions. Super super annoying!! 🤬 I don’t know how to reply, so I’m trying this.... It’s been happening for about a month and a half. It happened just yesterday. The bottom of the screen has a button that says Preview and a button that I believe says Steps. Also, when I send directions to my phone or email and I’ve rearranged the stops, it won’t send the updated route, only the way I originally entered the locations. Not. Happy.",1,Thank you for reporting this issue. When did you first notice this issue of not being able to start navigation? Can you tell us more about the options you see displayed at the bottom of the screen when you try to transition from directions mode to navigation mode?
"I think this is the first time since owning a smart phone in 12 years that I’m considering using a different maps app. It barely understands what direction I’m facing or what street I’m on anymore, constantly thinking I’m going the opposite direction or that I’m on a nearby street. And recommends the WORST possible routes to take. It crashes all the time, let’s me know about turns at the very last second, just stops running my route constantly and I have to restart, I have to constantly watch it to make sure it didn’t stop the route so I don’t miss a turn. Please don’t make me switch to Apple Maps. It’s terrible, but now Google Maps is worse.",0,
"Used it for years on the app and pc. I do like that it works with Apple CarPlay so that’s a plus but one thing about that I don’t like is it will “found a quicker route” while driving accept or decline but if you don’t do anything it automatically changes to quicker route. To me that’s only useful if there’s a road delay or accident up ahead. Once I’ve selected my route, I’d like it to stay on that route. Also, why isn’t there and option for search for shortest route instead of quickest route?",0,
"I love this app. I use it every day even to and from work because it knows about accidents before I do. The only thing I would change is location sharing. I had navigation on and my friend shared their location. Google maps wouldn’t load their location unless I turned off my navigation. Is there any way to fix that on my end, like a setting I can change or something? Thanks.",0,
"Please stop directing me to left turns at stop signs across multiple lanes of oncoming traffic from both directions. It's dangerous, almost always less efficient than just sending me another block down to the traffic light, and incredibly stressful! I often find it wants to route me in a zigzag through several of these turns when I could just travel in one straight line to a light and make a safe turn. Other than this it's a great app for the most part.",0,
"Used to love google maps until their recent updates. Since I’ve updated, the app regularly takes me down the wrong paths. I’m frequently finding the app instructing me to go one direction, only to have the app tell me to make a u-turn down the street, or in bad cases, a weird loop/backtracking on major highways. On some highways, the app seems to spaz on me and it will tell me to “stay on this route for xx miles” every 20-30 seconds (and I know it’s not my reception/carrier provider because Apple maps doesn’t do it!).

"Google maps has been flawless for me for years.  I trusted google to get me exactly where I needed to go on the fastest route. But since the last update, my arrow doesn’t move along the road smoothly and it has fallen behind my current location by a couple of miles.  The arrow is constantly spinning like I am spinning my cell phone I my hand.  In a couple of instances, it wanted me to turn around even though I knew I was going in the correct direction.

Please fix it as soon as possible because I need this app to help me to get directions. Thanks Dear, thanks for answer. When I want to get direction and push the button (direction) the banners show up but only for 1 second and they go away.

Are you still experiencing this? 4/19/18 Are you still experiencing this issue on version 4.48 of Google Maps?
I have tried quite a few of the navigation apps but I always come back to this one.  Mainly for its accuracy and interface with blue tooth devices.  I use mine mostly on my motorcycle. Only reason I didn’t score 5 out of 5 is I would still like to see it list current speed limit on the road you are on. I do a lot of long trips and i am not familiar with the local speed limit which as soon as most see you on a sport bike think you are speeding on purpose.,1,"Speed limits in navigation should be available in your country!

I have been using google map for navigation all the time. i had such wonderful experience during past years. But it’s been awhile it getting really bad. Like giving such worse routes with lie traffic conditions and the guidance arrow hanging on turns and changing suddenly the existing route during the driving which makes the driver confused. Well I’m a driver in SF. Hope it get better. Thanks,0,
"I’m sick of google maps changing my route for me. I hate the pop ups that say there is a faster route when I ON PURPOSE chose the route I want to take and I have to decline route propositions multiple times. I’m done. It’s making me late for work because I know this route I’m on now (which I did not choose!) is going to get backed up with traffic once I hit the city. Not using google maps again until this is fixed. It’s irritating beyond belief. I hate how every time I try to zoom out to view my route, it auto guides back to the close view following my car. I’m trying to drive and view my route, it should be easy, but it takes so much more of my attention than it should. I hate how it tries to get you on a toll road anytime it can manage, even when you have “avoid toll roads” selected and it asks multiple times if you want to take the faster route, which includes tolls, and you HAVE to decline or it will automatically change your route.",0,
"Locations don’t update properly. There’s been plenty of days were it says that my location I start from is where I was last the day before, even when I’ve been home and not gone anywhere yet. My daughter has her location shared with me and there have been times when it says she’s in a different town and she’s actually home at the same place as I am. I’d hate to have something happen and her location be wrong and not be able to find her so I’m looking for another location sharing app thats accurate and safe but in the meantime frequent phone calls and text will have to do",0,
Direction wise I rarely have a problem. But the most recent problem I’m having is whenever it tells a direction it also cuts off and completely stops my music from playing on my phone. Every time I have to exit out of maps and go to music app to start playing music again. Extremely annoying because it keeps notifying you of directions like every few minutes it seems like.,0,
Google maps is not allowing you to view your own maps you created. Until you fix that i will not put a five star review. Well a promise is a promise. They fixed the issue and now they get a 5 star! They have also added speed limit sign while you drive which is awesome! If they could get freeway lines set up like Apple maps that would be a perfect app.,1,"We appreciate you letting us know about this issue, and we thank you for your patience as we worked on the problem.

What I love about Google Maps? It is an all inclusive guide app that gives you an abundance of tools to help you with anything from travel itinerary to food reviews and entertainment to master guide pictures. I have been using it for years like most people. What is the first thing most people do when they are going somewhere? Check out my profile bayaerialdrone. I fly a drone and I use my Google Maps App always and forever.,0,
I enjoy using your map personally use with my personal vehicle. I sometimes try to use the Google map for work purposes but it’s not really Siri so friendly because sometimes it directs me to areas that a CDL vehicle is not allowed to drive on that’s why I rated the Google that with four stars instead of five but it is a great man and a great daily tool To use when needed hopefully in the near future you also have your Google map CDL Friendly for CDL drivers Thank you,0,
"Get rid of that useless /annoying ""you're on the fastest route available ""!!!! It serves no purpose, and it adds to the distraction. Also lately it shows out of the blue different itineraries . I was driving on interstate 85 from NC to GA . I was driving at night and there was no traffic . Google maps was giving me options to leave the interstate and go on a freakin triangle for absolutely no reason . I understand if it was traffic or road construction .",0,
"I am very pleased with Google maps,  I am confident and comfortable using Google Maps , I have never been miss lead in anyway or direction ! and the best part is I don’t have to look away from driving to find where I’m going because it tells me  ! this app is a multi-purpose connection to everything I need ! I use it for more than just a driving,  it is my daily information and driving directory .. I love it Sincerely yours HJP",0,
"Well, I've been using Google map for as long as I can remember. However, recently, I found the new updates actually is a degradation, which result in me searching for an alternative. If Google is working toward better the user experience, here are some of my humble suggestions: 1. Please bring back the MRT (Taipei, Taiwan) exit numbers on the map. I suppose this is generic, because all the exits are gone both in web or app version. (This is a major inconvenience!!) (This issue seems to be resolved slowly after two years) 2. Please update your map at least every 6 months, if not for the stores and shops, at least the major changes. Some of the stations were established, and it takes forever to show up on your map. 3. The most recent update made the map super slow to load, the street view would take as long as 1 minute or even more, perhaps think of some way to compress your files or app?",0,
"I love google maps and use it all the time. I prefer to have the step by step directions up on my phone so I know what’s coming next.

I miss the way it used to work : (",0,
"I’ve never had any issues with google maps on my older iPhones. So I’m baffled as to why I’m having issues with my iPhone 8 plus. When I’m on the highway, it always redirects me to local roads when there’s not even an exit to get off of, it’ll tell me to make u-turns. The blue area sometimes doesn’t line up with the direction I’m driving in, the map turns upside down, to the left, right...and I’m having the same issue with Waze too. It’s frustrating using navigational apps that can’t even get you to where you need to go without redirecting you, telling you to get off the highways when you shouldn't etc.",0,
"I usually use Waze, and the last 2 times I had a different phone (without Waze on it), and so I took Google Maps... only for the app to KEEP CHANGING THE ROUTE THAT IM GOING MID-DRIVE! It would tell me to one route, and then we’d stop at a light light before making a turn, and it would just drastically change it. Then my friend (who’s driving) would have to change lanes right then. Also, it took us through the sketchiest neighborhoods just to save us like a minute of time! Took us off the highway and through a bunch of small, partially abandoned, brutal neighborhoods in Pontiac, Michigan.",1,Thanks for your review!

"The widget doesn’t work right.  I pull up the widget and it shows the time to get to work or home.  You click go and the app opens, then freezes.  You then have to exit the app and re-enter the app from the main icon then type on search to get directions.  I real pain when you are behind the wheel and ready to go.  End up using Apple Maps instead because the widget does work like it is supposed to.  This has been a constant problem for the last two updates.  And since Waze uses google maps, Waze is just as messed up.",0,
"I just tried out Google maps on my iPhone (running on iOS 13) since the recent app update to version 5.28. And to my pleasant surprise, the turn-by-turn voice directions did not drop out and I also did not experience lag time in receiving directions—both problems I had been encountering since the iOS 13 upgrade. So I believe Google maps is finally synced with iOS 13.  Thanks!",0,
"After the new update, while using navigation, it will continually announce to continue straight on the street you’re on. Does this every mile or so which is beyond annoying as it interrupts music. It also switches to the screen that shows you’ve arrived too soon now. Also, I use the add stop feature in navigation so I have sometimes up to 10 addresses in navigation to plan my route. After I get to an address, and then go back to google maps to continue to the next address, the app will clear the entire list and go back to a blank map. Fix this it is awful. Not to mention the annoying Explore tab that I NEVER USE.",0,
"Today drove home from North Myrtle Beach, SC, to East Tennessee.  I know the way—I really didn’t need her, but I typed “Home” in the search bar and fired her up. She insisted I go a different way.  I was getting frustrated, because no matter how insistent I was in going the “right” way, she was more insistent that I do things her way.  So we decided “why not?” When we stopped to get coffee, I checked the weather map, to see if we were going to beat Hurricane Nate home.  As soon as I saw it, I realized what she was doing-she was keeping us as dry as possible. It was inevitable that we would hit heavy rain, but it was only for the last hour instead of the six hours it would have been on the usual route. Google Maps is great.  I knew that before.  But now I know it looks out for you, too.  Listen to her!",0,
"Undoubtedly the most useful map/navigation app out there... but every time it opens, it always defaults to not displaying traffic info.  Requires an account/login to keep defaults.  I suggest that logging in and manually turning traffic layers on are equally distracting to be messing with while driving.  The app leaves no other choice that I can see... what is wrong with remembering my preferences or just setting traffic info to come up by default?  Very frustrating and somewhat dangerous!",0,
"since I updated, it seems like the app is completely confused about what direction I am facing when I use the app. it also no longer will recalculate as I am going in real time— it will continue to tell me directions from whatever the location was when I first started driving... because it doesn’t know what direction I’m going it will often tell me the exact opposite of what I need to be doing which is very frustrating and confusing when in an unfamiliar location.",1,Thank you for reporting this issue.

"I have been a strong believer in using Google Maps wherever I go. However lately I have been rather dissapointed/frustrated with it. I have had it happen three times now where google actually routes me to the routes with the most traffic instead of the least. Each time, I am already on the route and have to call a friend to ask to look on their google maps only to find out that I took the slowest route instead of the fastest. Each time I have to uninstall and reinstall the app. Once they fix this, I will return to using it. For now it’s Waze for me.",0,

Street names refuse to appear when that’s all you want to see - you know, like a map. Hitting the centering feature causes the screen to zoom into a level that’s often absurd and useless at freeway speeds.

I understand ads is how they make their money, but c’mon, this efffing ridiculous! Otherwise, that app ROCKS, but not enough to offset the annoyance of that ridiculous pop up on start up, Apple Maps is now the go-to and I hate Apple maps.",0,
"The navigation from this app is the most helpful, I’ve ever used. Several times I doubted the viability of taking a different route or forbid a longer one, but it is always to stay clear of traffic or problem spots w/o delay.

"What happened?  It used to be much cleaner and easier to use. Now the screen is loaded with all sorts of stuff that distract you from safe driving. It is worse than Waze in that it will show you every business open at any one time. From sandwich shops to gas stations to food stores, it is all on that screen. Very messy. It has gone down hill while Apple Maps has gotten much better. This is truly not a map for driving. Walking maybe. But drive at your own risk.

The bus ends up being late which throws off the traveler or for me in this instance, I’ll start walking or take a connecting bus the the next stop to catch up and will miss the same bus that was previously shown on maps as departed.",0,

I am not sure if the app is just corrupted or I am doing something wrong. I was in one location and tried to go home using my “Home” address and the app showed a different state.

I even checked my home address that I saved in the app to make sure I did not type it incorrectly by accident but found no errors at all.  The only explanation I have is that the app didn’t pick the satellite signals because it was raining hard and overcast.,0,
"Google has the best data. Real time traffic data and estimated arrival time is very accurate, the amount of places and the data for each place is amazing.

It’s a great app only 2 things I’d say missing from getting a 5 star one dark mode when in maps view u know where it just shows the streets and address and nothing more and the second is you should work with another app company or do this yourself either one works where u can choose your own icon showing where u are like what if someone wanted Scooby Doo’s head for a icon or anime character head like goku from dragonball Super or cooler looking arrow or a football teams helmet,0,
"I really hate new logo. Please fix the zoom-in when zooming in on streets. They’re, first off, too white, too light and cannot properly identify boundary lines when zoomed in. Like, the streets disappear from existence. Constant having to zoom out to view properly. Then there’s the name issue. You could see the names of the streets, until zooming in on. Other than that, “G-maps” is still by far one of the most frequent Google apps used by me and it continues to impress me from time to time. Waiting on new upgrades by Google. Thanks.",0,
"I swear the GPS has gotten slower and less accurate over the years. Google maps is the best option but that’s not saying much. My number one complaint is the location of the “exit” button. Every time I go to pick up my phone, my hand hits the exit button and ends the navigation. I don’t have fat fingers. I’m a relatively savvy smart phone user. I can’t be the only person having this problem. And then when I accidentally bump the end button close to my destination, the app assumes I’m walking and automatically switches to walking directions right at crunch time when I’m trying to figure out where I need to go. I’ve also noticed that the app almost always defaults to highways even when the highway has terrible traffic and there are other alternate routes available. Overall it’s a pretty poor showing from Google. They obviously have both the funds and the technology to do better.",0,
I really like that with Google maps it is easy to look through the steps without committing to the route. It is easy to enter and change addresses. I love that in the upper left corner it shows an arrow of what the next move will be AND it shows how far it is until that move. I got this phone from my sister and it had a different map program which I found very annoying!,0,
Had some spare time. Was cruising around maps &amp; pulled up Staunton. Looked to see if Mariano's Lunch was still there. My cousin likes the place when he visits Staunton. He sent me a pic of the place &amp; an aerial map. It still has the same sign it had in the 60's/70's. Then I looked to see if Mary Baldwin was still there &amp; if St Francis Catholic Church was still standing &amp; also if 220 N. New St. was still there. Google maps not only gave me an aerial view; it provided me w/ street views! How exciting!&amp; a good tool.,0,
"Still doesn’t show your favorite places. You have to go through your places then favorites. If you accidentally hit the wrong place it will reset. Then you have to start over. Also if you click on a place to read the reviews, and you like it. The comments will reset to default. They won’t be in order by newest one. Oh and in navigation mode it takes too long to update you on when your turn is. It’s hard especially when you’re driving through a city with lots of construction and your unfamiliar. Now when you leave the app the map resets, you have to keep turning on traffic every time you open it.",0,
"I’ve installed this most updated version and then shocking to find that many of my starred places which I collected for years were gone! Tried to uninstall then reinstall, log off then log in but it just DIDN’T work... Funny is that all my starred places are there when using Google Maps on my PC so I guess the data are still somewhere in Google’s server or cloud. It’s just they’re LOST on the apps. This is absolutely unacceptable and I’ve learned from the Google Maps Help Community that this already and continues to happen to loads of users. Seriously google please do something, we want our starred places back!",0,
"Being a transient hobo for most of my life, getting from point A to point B has been somewhat difficult over the years. Since I loaded Google Maps on my newly found I Phone, I am delighted to say, it sure makes finding the Rescue Missions and Soup Kitchens easier to pinpoint! I use this product ALL the time in my daily rambling. Whether by freight train, or by leveled thumb, my journey to nowhere has become much more enjoyable. Great product!",0,
"Before I updated my phone  three months ago I was able to use Google maps and I would use it often. Now, I am unable to use it and it is making me mad. I would like to know how to fix the issue! Every time I go into the map it tells me it is unable to reach the server. My location settings are on. I have tried resetting the phone. I have since then updated my phone two more times.  I feel like I have tried everything. I have taken my phone to Apple and they said it’s Googles problem. I tried adding Google maps to my kids phones and their phones are giving the same message. What do I do now Google?",0,
"For months, there has been a disconnect between the Google Maps app and Google Maps accessed through a browser that has gone unresolved/unacknowledged despite repeated pleas from users.  Saved places, “Want To Go” lists, and various other personal lists that are viewable/accessible in a web browser seemingly disappear from the Google Maps app.  A place saved to the “Want  To Go” list in the app will be viewable for only a few days at best before the app list resets to 0.  For those of us who use the Google Maps app for work/planning purposes and especially during travel, this is extremely frustrating.",0,
"Please add functionality to let users know that a business is in a mall. I know you can just zoom in on the map to look at it, but when adding a stop along route I usually just look at how much time it will take to get there. When it’s in a mall it takes a lot more time than just a drive thru on the side of a road. Was in a rush for a family emergency when this happened so that’s the only time I’d say it matters. Otherwise, people should just relax. Thanks.",0,
"Love this app but one of the recent updates changed the way the blue MRT line appears on Taipei’s map. Zoomed out, it looks exactly the same color as Taipei’s green MRT line. It used to be super easy to tell them apart but now when I’m just referencing the map instead of using navigation, I really have to zoom in and double check because the colors are hard to tell apart. I’ve taken wrong turns and stations twice already. Please switch back to the old blue and green!!!",0,
"I went on a day trip to visit the small museum two towns to the east (I think you can already tell where I live haha) and I must say that I had an easy time getting there except for the flat tire. Then, when I got there some foreign looking fellow asked me how to get to the hospital and I had to drive away because I think it was a scam, very scary. Anyway the museum was nice except for the musty smell. I rate the trip four out of five stars thank you. Millicent Hobson",0,
"Love the new UI in the iPhone X. I do have one complaint though. Exiting the app requires two swipes up now to get to the home screen. The first swipe will bring up the options menu then a second one to exit and frankly, that gets annoying after a while. Even after exiting the app and opening it, the menu is still pulled up and I have to swipe it down to get the full screen view again. Perhaps a tap to bring up the menu instead of a swipe to avoid the confusion with the exit gesture in the iPhone X?",1,"2/28/18 Did this resolve your concerns? 12/20/17 Thank you for letting us know about this issue, and your patience as we fixed the problem. We appreciate it! With update 4.42, Google Maps should now be working as usual."
"I was actually experiencing issues in your mobile web client, but I’ll leave the review here because your app has been useless as well.  For the mobile web client, I’m trying to click the “view pictures option” and it it’s automatically takes me to reporting... and I’ll I’m trying to do is view photos.  As for this app, which used to be my default map, which is now only used as my “absolute last resort” app, I’m sick of the directions updating a minute (or more) later.  If I have to turn left in 100ft, I don’t want to find out after I’ve already very much passed my turn.  You really need some serious content fixes across the board.",0,
"Today we had lunch at Sunset Coastal today and we wised we could have given you a 5+.  From the time we called to set up our reservation with them to the time we left “full as a tick”, we could not have asked for a better experience!

"For the past month or so, Google Maps has been extremely dysfunctional in that it’s never able to tell where I am and therefore the GPS doesn’t work properly. It seems like it can’t sense when I’m moving and have left my starting point. I end up having to just click the “directions” tab and follow the step by step version like mapquest 😒 I’ve updated the app each time there’s an update and my iOS system is up to date so I don’t quite understand where the issue is originating. I love Google Maps but this is very inconvenient.",0,
"First of all, Google Maps is my “go to” app for all of my trips. It works well, it’s clean (not cluttered up with junk) and is easy to use. Lately, over the last couple of weeks, there’s been one problem that’s making me consider using another app until it gets fixed. If I’m on a route and, god forbid, I deviate from said route, I’ll look up to find the route no longer there. No rerouting, it’s not there until I join the route later down the road. Not sure what’s going on, but it’s annoying. iOS 11.3.1 iPhone 8",0,
"By far the simplest, most straight forward personal navigation app available. Of course it does not, nor does it attempt to meet the standard of true stand alone GPS devices such as Garmin etc. The app is reliable and will get you to your destination without too much difficulty for the user. Inputs are intuitive and even the most navigation challenged individual will find their destination with ease.",0,
This has been my go to app for several years now and suddenly you’re taking me on safari in the back country! Wth?! The last “shortcut” you took me on the “road” if you could call it that was literally 2 Wagon Train ruts in the Outback and I had to have an axle repaired after that trek! I’m scared to go off the beaten path now. Please fix it. This is not the only time you’ve sent me on a wild goose chase!  I work in different model homes everyday and mostly drive to places I’m not familiar with and I depend on your accuracy! You’re starting to scare me lately!,0,
I have been using google maps for several months. It seems to get worse everyday. The update/refresh speed for gps tracking is terrible. The maps take forever to load sometimes even on a very fast connection. This is unacceptable for a company with the resources and revenues of Google. Update: when you open Google maps you see the last place you were at. When you select “Home” from your places and close the panel on the left it takes you right back to where you were last visit instead of Home. How do I get financially compensated for beta testing google maps?,0,
"I think this app works good because it has excellent accuracy. I find this important because it is updated nicely with all the new information. Google apps also makes a change in route very easy which is important if you want to avoid traffic. I also like the appearance of the app as it is easy to find everything. Also, the traffic information is helpful knowing that it will be slower and congested. Overall, I would recommend this app to a friend.",0,
"I would like to say this company was very professional and did an amazing job. My bar top is 135” long and it required a seam. The seam was done at the shop at 130” and it looks beautiful. You have to stare for a while to even see a small mark of the seam. Everything from start to finish was great. They were also very quick (10 days from start to finish) once Lowe’s gave them the information. Thank you, Cleve and Jennifer",0,
"Gives the best directions, but it seems like the folks at Google are actively trying to make this app hard to use. Why does it always zoom back in when I try to zoom out and see the whole route? Why do I need to tap on “directions” to choose driving/transit/biking/walking? Why does it always assume I need directions from where I am? Wastes so much data calculating routes when I’m looking for directions from somewhere I’m going to be. Wish things like this could be changed in settings.",0,

"I just re-downloaded the 125MB Google Maps app after it told me I was offline. Downloaded from where? The internet, of course, which is precisely the “line” I was presumably “off” while sitting across the room from my gigabit-capable WiFi access point. This isn’t a one-time thing. It’s happened at least weekly for the last 6 months, and almost entirely on WiFi. It’s never actually the case that I’m offline: every other app, from Safari to Maps to Mail to the ever-slow App Store work great. Google Maps seems incapable of finding the internet: perhaps it should ask for turn by turn directions.",0,
"This is my go to map, but it has become very glitchy lately. If I miss a turn or decide to take a different direction, it doesn’t always automatically reroute like it used to. Also, if I click to check an alternate route, it will sometime stop mapping me all together. I have to manually close the entire app, then reopen it, and reinput my destination. This is dangerous to do in traffic. This doesn’t always happen, but it’s EXTREMELY frustrating when it does. I really hope they fix these issues soon!!!!! I may have to try out Apple maps.",0,
"It is very helpful when I am on the rode with my Mom and we need to know where the place is that we are suppose to go it is easy and helpful! One suggestion is that you could make it so it picks up your area and then shows you locations close to you. Over all, Google Maps is a helpful, easy, and useful app to use whenever you need to find a location you don’t know where it is! Thank you!",0,
"We have a 43' RV with a bit in Rand McNally nav system that allows input of vehicle hieght and weight and, in theory, should help you avoid roads inappropriate for your vehicle.  Updating the Rand is clumsy and it isn't reposive to traffic.  Any chance Google is working on allowing users to enter vehicle details and filtering routes through a bridge height and weight database? I prefer to use Google but it has also directed me on roads that make no sense even if in a car!",0,
"As a truck driver I use this app almost everyday. Not for directions, I have a truck gps for that , but for traffic conditions and to pinpoint points of entry for my deliveries, and it has been wonderful until the new update. It takes a very long time to load even the major highways traffic and if you try to scroll the route it takes that much longer if it ever loads them fully!! Please stop trying to worry about telling people where the cops are and go back to having a reliable product that people can use and know it’s reliable.  If people want to drive like idiots let them pay the consequences!!!!!",0,
"Google maps has been great and my go to navigation system over the past couple of years. As of late , however , it has been very unreliable. When driving, the navigation fails to update when I make a turn. It won’t continue onto the next step. Even after I continue driving for 15-20 more minutes it won’t update. I’ve done extensive testing &amp; this happens so often it’s annoying to deal with. Even after updating the app &amp; refreshing the route I’m taking , it doesn’t solve the issue. Looks like I’ll be going back to plain old apple maps.",0,
"The share trip progress feature freaked me out!!!!! As soon as I tapped on it it recommended sharing locations with people I don’t even know , like for example, a customer service contact I recently emailed and a scammer who also sent me an email.. there is also no way to block google maps from accessing your gmail contacts. I’m totally freaked by this.. I was one tap away from sharing my location with unknown people .. I am a well known google maps contributor or actually a “famous contributor” as google last described me on my monthly timeline. I will have to stop contributing and disconnect my gmail from google maps. Stay safe guys.",0,
"The map freezes and I don’t know if it’s a glitch I’ll try it out on my new phone when I get it, but it’s happening frequently were It shows I’m on a different route, but it thinks I’m still on the same route..but I am not going that way...so that makes it very difficult when you don’t know where you’re going. I have also had to go through a toll just to get back on the highway before because of Google‘s directions. I have a love-hate relationship with it and right now I’m hoping it will get better with a new phone better programming or or something with the app being upgraded.",1,Thank you for letting us know about this issue.

I am so looking forward to working with such an outstanding company and its professional employees.  Thank you for everything.  Happy sleeping!",0,
"I’ve noticed an increasing number of times that the app will change my destination point during the route there. It happens mid-trip, so I don’t always notice. It seems to change the destination to places I’ve been to before, but not always. So if I’m at point A, and I want to get to point B, I’ll set it up on the app to do the turn by turn directions; I’ll say to start the trip, and then at some point along that trip, the app decides that the end destination is actually point C and will direct me there. I won’t have touched or changed the destination point, the app does it by itself. It means you can trust the app.",0,

I give a top recommendation to anyone to go with Budget Car Rental!",0,
"The reviews say that Google Maps is supposed to send directions to the Apple Watch. It does not. For this reason, I tried to use the Apple Maps app, which does, but which also is horrible. I also find Google Maps to be quite buggy when I’m trying to get directions on foot. In particular, the arrow takes a long time to figure out which direction I am going and frequently veers off course.",0,
The bus schedule never shows up correctly while searching for it making it impossible to find out when your bus is coming if they don’t even show the option. I used it to get from home to school and to work and a year ago it started doing this which is dangerous at night time when all your trying to do is get home. Way too many glitches with the app when I’m driving and sometimes it doesn’t even give me the right directions over all use a less wide based app because then maybe they will care more about your experience and it actually working than how many downloads it gets.,0,

Great app ad works fantastic with Maps Plus. I use these two apps for work all day long. One small hiccup; Google Maps is having a difficult time tracking my real time as I’m traveling. Shows that I’m much farther from my destination. It’s not tracking my turn by turn which it used to. Sometimes the navigation thinks I’m on the service road when I’m actually on the freeway. I stand firm with this app and need it with as much as I travel for work. Please fix this. Ado,0,
"Please consider adding support for rest stops. It would be great to be able to a) check where the next one is along my route, and b) for the voice prompts to automatically pause while I’m taking advantage of one. They’re always pretty easy to find your way into and out of, so voice prompts with directions on how to return to the highway are unnecessary - and a little awkward when you’ve got the phone in your pocket and are already inside the facility.",0,
"I am angry that google is forcing people into getting their app by acquiring waze then ruining it on purpose to kill the waze community. They were jealous that a small company had the best product, so what do they do? Buy them out, then kill it and their community to creat a monopoly on google maps. I used to use waze to drive around the country, now you can’t if you wanna more than 30-50miles, the route finder will time out. Google claims their servers can’t handle all the demand. Out right lie. The google maps is inferior to the experience we used to have on waze, but now it’s the only option unless you wanna big $$ for “premium” features on all other apps.",0,
I have been using Google Maps for what seems like forever. It is easy to use and is the best. Whenever I want to go somewhere that I am not familiar with the route having this app is very reassuring. I have never gotten lost while using it. Directions are spot on. It even tells me which lane I should be in for the next step. Always the quickest route and also detours me when it knows there is traffic ahead. Awesome!,0,
For the last couple of WEEKS I would use this gps and it won’t start calculating my movement for almost an hour. I work in various places in line no island and I need my gps. I would have to look at the directions ahead of time to know where I’m going. I would close the app and open it again several times and it would still have me near my home. I don’t know why it’s doing that now. It won’t tell,0,
"Am I wrong or did Google Maps have the ability to save in some kind of memory log all the addresses* that I typed in previously (without my having had to enter them into my Contacts list)? Maybe it was that Blackberry that I had back in the old days. My situation is this... I am looking for a replacement vehicle and addresses are scattered all over town, out of town, even a few across the State line. Can a feature be added to add Contact :from: the address that I have given into Google Maps? Truthfully, I would rather have my default be to remember.

I also wish it would save that direction even after I get to location so I can come back the same way if I need directions to get back out. Plz see if you can make this software possible.",0,
"This is the worse version of google maps in recent memory. There are so many bugs that it’s barely useable. Custom maps basically don’t work. There are so many problems with custom maps I can’t list them all here. Other issues are that the app freezes constantly. I’ll be driving and it will suddenly kick me out of the route I’m in forcing me to close the app, search the location again, and start over. They released this too quickly to have it out for the 15th birthday of the app and it shows. Do not update to this version. You will regret it.

"I’ve loved google maps, it typically updates faster and is much more accurate than others I’ve used, but the last few times I’ve used it, it randomly goes off course and starts giving directions to get off the freeway and then back on or changes directions several times in the span of a minute. I know it’s got to be a bug since it’s only happened recently, just hoping it gets fixed quickly!",0,
"I used to love Google Maps, it was the best overall gps app but recently it has been absolutely terrible. It has been directing me to routes that take 2-3 times longer than the quickest route. It also often tells me that roads are closed when they are actually open, or tells me they are open when they are closed. Another problem is that after typing in an address, the blue highlighted route doesn’t show up. It also often doesn’t know which direction I am facing for more than 10 seconds which makes figuring out the correct way to go very confusing. Fix this Google!",0,
"Got this to replace the apparently inferior Apple Maps. I like the commute feature, but I have different schedules on different days so I’d prefer if there was a way to set arrival and departure times individually rather than having the same time for every day of the week.

"I have used google maps for YEARS. It was a very nice option opposed to apple maps, and the much too cluttered feel of Waze...BUT, I digress.... The past few months (maybe 6+ now), I’ve been receiving extremely terrible directions from google maps. It frequently will tell me completely nonsense directions that lead me to nowhere or in a complete circle, only to end up back where I was. Google maps recently once told me there was a traffic jam ahead, routed me off the highway onto a small road that went straight to a toll booth, and onto the highway again. I’ve had many similar issues like this, to where now I just open google maps to get a general sense of direction, before using my own intuition like in the days of Mapquest, and earlier. I’m not sure if this is a problem local to my area near DC, but I thought it would be taken care of months ago. Until this is fixed, and maybe even after its fixed....I’ll be on Waze.",0,
Used Google Maps for traveling over Christmas weekend. The app routed us through the bigger cities on the quickest routes. We were not bogged down in heavy traffic. Going to our destination and returning we were taken on different routes. We travelled during afternoon/evening (the busiest times to travel during a holiday weekend) and the length of time it took us to go 470 miles/returning 470 miles were very similar and on target.,0,

Also, how come it doesn’t give you the most common sense route, even when there is no traffic? Come on! Get it together.",0,
"Google Maps is pure magic, really. It changed all our lives. Just one question about one detail - why don’t they focus on the search field when you open the app?

"Why have the locations I starred disappeared? I can see the locations that I have as favorites and want to go.

When choosing a route to drive and activating when the app has a pop up showing a quicker route by default it chooses and changes to the different route if the user doesn't hit dismiss. Who stares at their phone driving down the road? Please make the default route the one the user chose first don't change it on your own.  Towing a large trailer I choose routes around cities even though it's a few minutes more. Google maps sent me through the center of Dallas when I specifically chose the north bypass. I'm driving in crazy traffic not staring at the phone waiting for a random pop up so I can decline it!,1,"Thanks for your review!

"In the latest version, the contrast between streets and everything else is non-existent. Everything is white: the streets are full-blown white, while the rest of the areas are slightly darker, but not by much. There is a slight blue-ish shadow on some streets, but its barely visible. If it wasn't for other layers, you would not be able to tell where the streets are. Compare and contrast to the screen-shots in the AppStore, were there is a nice contrast of gray and white for streets and terrain. Happening on a iPhone Xs, running iOS 12.4.1. Started happening after the latest update to the Google Maps app. Tried changing different display settings on the app and it had no effect.",1,"5/2/18 Did this resolve your concerns? 4/12/18 Thanks for letting us know about this issue, and your patience as we fixed the problem.

I would like to turn off sections of the app that I don’t use. I commute to and from work and don’t desire to have the nearby places pop up as soon as it opens. Let me decide when I need food etc. The app keeps directing me to the highway even when it advises you that there are 30 minutes delays. Why?? I use it typically for the traffic. Why does it still have maps you have used for many months in your history and the only way to get rid of them is to delete hundreds of them one at a time!!,0,
"My biggest complaint is that it really kills your battery, like big time. I just got back from a three week road trip across America. My phone’s (iPhone X) battery would be near half only an hour into a new day. I feared that it was my phones battery degrading. But now that I’m back home, my phone’s battery life lasts all day just like before I left. I’m on it quite a bit too. I go on a road trip annually, I didn’t have this problem last year nor the year before. Not sure why it’s killing my batter now.",0,
"When my girlfriend and I take trips and use apple maps, we get in arguments about directions because the app does not tell you when to turn quickly enough.  Google maps tells you when to turn ahead of time, and it tells you again when you're about to turn at the appropriate time.  No more arguing about directions, thanks Google maps!",0,
Modern Tire in Farmington has been great. I’ve been using them for many years and I’ve been happy with their efficient service and good work. They also helped my niece who was visiting from out of state. They didn’t have the exact part but they fixed her car so that she could get home. They found the part for her when she returned home. I thought they went above and beyond to help her. Very happy with their service.,0,
I like using this app a lot. But there’s one thing that’s frustrating for me. It overestimates the time to your destination. I compared the time traveling on this app to the google maps page on my desktop. The desktop had me arriving at my destination in 30 minutes but the app said 1 hour and 45 minutes. That’s a huge difference and so frustrating! Please fix this bug to get a more accurate travel time!,0,
"I’m sick of Google being so far behind with respect to app features! 1.) Where are the speed limits??  Waze has it (a Google product). Apple maps has it. But Google maps...nope. 2.) Please help me understand why the layers button disappears when you start the route. You can’t change to satellite without pulling the menu up, going to the settings, scrolling down and hitting the button. Want to change the view back?  You have to go through the same thing. Extremely annoying. If anything Google should be trying to outshine Apple on its own phone. They’re failing.",1,"Speed limits in navigation should be available in your country! Thank you for your patience as we roll this feature out. To use this feature (once it’s available to you) in the latest version of Google Maps just start driving navigation.

It works as usual but recently if I’m playing music instead of lower the music and saying turn left (for example) it actually pauses the music then says turn left then plays it back. A couple of months ago it didn’t do that. I dont know if it’s a new feature for safer driving or a bug but if it’s a new feature I feel that we should have an option to choose fade music to the background or the new play pause thing. PLEASE HELP THIS IS A BIG PET PEEVE!!,0,
"This app has saved me a lot of time and stress. I was new to the town and didn’t know my way around at all. My since of directions is slim to none, and this app broke down the directions flawlessly.

Google maps is a great place to explore your local area or more especially a new area it’s a wonderful place to know the best restaurants in the great little shops that are off the beaten path define that hidden treasure and great deal of thing that I like most about the contributions that locals or forever patrons may add are the places where you can find great customer service itHelps and an experienced traveler feel more secure and safe in their travels,0,
"I’m giving this 5 stars because it has been a great resource in helping me with getting around and learning the new area in since I’ve moved. The ONLY negative comment I have to say about the app is the inaccurate gps reading via this app and gps based apps (Uber, Lyft, Pokémon go, etc...) that happens from time to time. Still going to give it a 5 star with the hopes that they will fix this issue when it presents itself in the future.",0,
"I cannot begin to explain the amount of high blood pressure this app has given me, how this app has caused me to be late to work and other important events due to the app being really confused and not loading at a proper speed and the constant extreme glitching gets really annoying especially when you're trying to listen to music and it just keeps rerouting and talking for a second then reroutes again. This app is cancer don't get it. Don't get apple maps either they both are awful and I can't tell which is worse. Probably this one, I've never screamed while using apple maps but I have countless times using this crap app.",0,
"I’ve been using Google Maps since around 2012 and it is probably still the best navigation app out there because of all of the data Google has, but the last two years of updates have not been beneficial to the consumer, seems like they are adding features they think you like but really it’s adding complications and bogging down the app .I hate the single finger zoom in and out! I mean who uses one finger to zoom!  It takes up so much of my time just finagling with the app! Keep it simple Google!!!!",0,

"Google Maps is certainly a great product. Huge array of information, easy to use, real time traffic information, everything beautiful. However, it just can’t correctly predict the time of arrival, the more you stay in traffic, even without any significant changes in traffic intensity or extension, it just doens’t get it right. You start the journey with an arrival time of 18h30, by the middle you are by 18h40 and you end at 18h58. Every single day. My wife and I already have the “Google Prediction time” which encompass a standard deviation of +-30 minutes on the arrival time.",0,
"Ever since the recent update this app has been absolute garbage. As someone in Sales who drives a lot, I use GPS services all the time and would prefer one that works. My location in Google Maps jumps all over the place and redirects me down the wrong roads, and sometimes it will freeze and leave me missing turns and off track from my route. Thinking this was an issue with my phone, I tried Apple Maps and have had no issues. Fix the issue and I will use Google Maps, but until then I will continue using Apple Maps as it does the job it’s supposed to and doesn’t constantly get me lost and late.",0,
"I used to use Google maps every single day because I'm not the best at direction. Lately when I try to swipe up and view the directions, it crashes. I cleared this app data and did everything the developer said, I even undownloaded it and redownloaded it. It still doesn't work. Also, when I Google something and then press for directions, it no longer automatically opens the app. I'm not sure why it's not working lately but it used to be my favorite.

Great app to help find multiple ways to get where you are going. Been using for over a decade and through the years it has become more reliable on how long it will take to get to where you need. Traffic has a huge effect on how long it takes and makes reasonable changes. Developers are creating new roads which this app knows and can save a lot of time.,0,
So the only thing I don’t like so far and I don’t know if this just happens to me but when I’ve reached my destination I usually manually kill the app or end the directions. But I’ve noticed that whatever prior notifications I’ve had about making turns still remain in my home notification screen. I’d figure since I’d kill the app or end directions all notifications about getting there would also disappear but they don’t.,0,
I’ve been using google maps for a few years and at the time It was honestly the best app. For some reason for almost about a year now it starts to throw me off grid and starts re-routing. At first I thought it was a little glitch but it’s been happening at the worst moments especially driving near areas you’re not familiar with.. I really hope it gets better not sure if other people are experiencing these issues. It was an amazing app I love google I’m just not sure what’s going on with their map app.. almost afraid to use it now since it can’t give me proper directions..,1,"Thank you for your review!

"Since upgrading to the latest version I’m experiencing crazy bugs on my iPhone 6S. It will stop giving me audio directions or pointing the map in the direction I’m going, at random, and then after awhile start doing so again. When it’s being defective it orients the map north (not in the direction I’m going) and will “freeze” in place, acting like I’m not moving. And yes, I know there’s a setting to toggle map orientation between north and the direction you’re facing; that toggle doesn’t work at all when the app is malfunctioning. This is a defect, not user error, and it’s bad enough that I’ll need to start using Apple Maps if they don’t fix it very soon.",0,
"For the longest I always praised how far superior Google Maps was over Apple Maps. However, as time has gone on, that has proved to be the complete opposite. Google consistently faces the wrong direction (even when removing the feature that has it always pointing north ....seriously what a crap feature anyways). I recently travelled to Texas and Google behaved so poorly during my drive I had to switch to Apple. It kept taking me to completely wrong exits and attempted to extend my trip back home by an hour (when the drive was already 16 hours). Getting rid of Google and never using again. You guys seriously need to get it together",0,
"There should be an estimated cost for tolls on route option. And also an “avoid tolls unless it saves you x amounts of minutes” option. I live right next to a toll road and when i drive around my town it often tells me to take the toll road when it saves me maybe a minute or two of time. But i also drive far often so i dont want to toggle the “avoid tolls” option back and forth every day. If the toll saves me more than five or ten minutes, its worth it though.",0,
"I started my trip on Tuesday, 27 November and arrived at a Air Force Base in California on November 30. The distance was 3056 miles. This was my first trip using Google Maps and it was good one! In all cases I was directed to my many stops in a very efficient manner.  All of the “extras” provided; Hotels, gas stations, restaurants and historical locations were easily displayed. I strongly recommend use of the Google Maps APP to everyone. The updates were accurate and timely on my trip.

"We live in Columbus, GA and bought a new home in a new build subdivision. People have been in this subdivision for nearly 3 years now. Most of the delivery companies around here and restaurants/delivery services use Google maps. And since our new address never comes up on Google maps we can never get anything delivered.

It would be nice to customize those different lists with different colors. That way you know what you want to clic on the map. Also the other issue is that I created other maps for work (my maps) and on the PC chrome browser I am able to create, edit, delete and see the map.

I semi-retired my Garmin GPS because all I have to do now is plug my iPhone into the USB on my Silverado and open my contact list, pick a contact, click on the map and presto, my Google Maps pops up on my display and the navigation to my destination begins.

"I updated this app in mid November 2017, and that again today December 5, 2017. Ever since the update I am unable to get accurate directions because the app is unable to triangulate my location, or it takes 10 or 15 minutes while driving for it to triangulate my location. It also doesn’t know The direction I am heading because the arrow is always pointed the wrong way, backwards or sideways.  Of course it was working great until I updated. Worth mentioning, I updated from iOS 10 to iOS 11 around the same time I first updated this app and it seems like that’s about when everything went to hell",0,

"Google maps is my go to app for searching nearby businesses to GPS. With the X swipe up home feature, Google should move it’s swipe up location somewhere else.

"Used to be the best mapping app, hands down. Now it’s a frustrating, almost piece of junk. It gets roads wrong. It’s led me to the wrong location numerous times. It tells me I’m not somewhere that I actually am. Isn’t updated for long, ongoing construction. And lately I’ve noted a really irritating trend where EVERYTIME I turn the app on, I have to tell it to avoid tolls (it used to remember), and even then on a recent trip through Dallas it kept telling me it “found a faster route” aka a toll road, and when I ignored it by not touching my phone cuz I was driving and trying to be safe, it automatically rerouted me to the toll 😡",0,
Something most people should know is that when you’re using your phone as a phone it’s using cellular data. And while you use google maps as a gps device it also uses that same cellular signal. Not to mention hopping between towers while you drive. Your map app on any phone will skip on you if you’re using the data it needs for a conversation.,0,
"Maps has recently changed to where it assumes I’ve made a turn at the place of turn. If it’s a red light and I’m suppose to make a right turn but I haven’t yet- the map turn my whole map in that direction. It’s bad when you’re paying attention to the road/call and don’t notice the map doing that, it can throw your whole route off. It also rotates the whole map in a 180 all of the sudden at random times. You could be going on a highway at 70mph and all of the sudden, you have to make a u turn. Silly developers. Hope this gets fixed because Apple is no better with their maps app.",0,
"Google Maps has a mind of its own. Use this app at your own risk! We had already mapped our route and reviewed it before leaving home. However, it kept changing our route and trying to take us through the most congested part of Atlanta. Later, without warning or asking for confirmation at the last minute before an exit, it rerouted us off the interstate through unlit pot hole laden backwoods winding roads without any shoulder into a dilapidated part of  Birmingham late at night. Our surroundings looked like a scene from a Jeepers Creepers horror film. We will NEVER EVER use Google Maps again! Using this app put our lives and our car at risk.",0,
Well... google no longer finds anything I’m looking for. Shopping disappeared first “Real product searches are a thing of the past.” Then the search engine broke. Now that hurt. Ad algorithms have replaced Google’s infamous search logic. Strike 3 google. Now I can’t even find my way with your maps app. You were the standard google. I guess that is just the Waze it goes- and what happens when you move resources from your maps team to a new app purchased for navigation “that makes it easier to display ads in app while driving.” “Worry about your own fortunes gentlemen. The deepest circle of he** is reserved for betrayers and mutineers.”,0,
This has been my go to app for directions for many years and I couldn’t use because I needed to find a place within the app to either link it to an account or click the not link it to an account.

"Love google maps but the product is buggy on iOS. Keeps crashing, sometimes while I’m using directions while driving!

"This was my absolute go to app for directions.  However, in the past three months it has stopped working.  It will start by giving me verbal directions then after a a turn or two it will either freeze or just stop taking.  Now the map might still on occasion still work but there will not be any verbal instructions.  This means at best I have to have the phone in my hand to follow the map.  Not what I’d call the safest thing to do. I don’t know what happened.  I have reloaded the app three times and the results are the same.  I wish it would be fixed.  I’ve resorted to Apple Maps which works fine but just isn’t as good.",0,
"I use Google Maps numerous times per week and sometimes multiple times in a day. The major gripe I have with the current version is that the “Welcome to ‘State’” banner doesn’t disappear after it displays. It used to immediately disappear after a few seconds. The problem is that it covers the bottom of the screen controls and other data. I have to restart the app every time the “Welcome” banner appears. Otherwise, I have to access to arrival time, settings, etc. Very frustrating.",1,"Thank you for letting us know about this issue, and your patience as we fixed the problem. We appreciate it!

"If I want to find the nearest gas station and I’m traveling on the freeway heading north or southbound, I don’t want to exit the freeway and turn around at a freeway intersection if the nearest gas station means I have to turn around. Nothing is more of a bother than backtracking, it wastes our time and frankly our patience. It would really be helpful if you had a feature that would choose your wanted destination in the direction you are already heading. Often many times there are mistakes with the listings as well, I will want to go to the nearest “destination” and I will pass a couple of them before driving to one that was obviously not the nearest one.",0,
"I use it for average 5 hours a day in the busy city of LA. It’s getting better and better, the updates are working. I was in London for 3 days and headed to Paris for a week. I used G Maps for public transport (bus, train etc). It’s amazing how google maps are up to date. It works even when you’re walking to find the nearest bus station. It made my trip a lot more fun and no error at all! I felt like a local in a different country. Cheers!",0,
"I used to Love google maps, but now I’m looking for something else. Both my husband &amp; I have found the same issues with this version. Here are the consistent problems:  It does not have you on the correct road, even when you’ve been on the same highway for hours; it’s not real- time and doesn’t keep up with where you are driving; it gives you negative feet when you’ve made a turn it told you to make; and it doesn’t re-route quickly anymore. It doesn’t matter where we are, same issuers whether it’s rural, suburban or city driving. The gps location services does not seem to work anymore.",0,
I received two sets of bad directions to different locations in the past 2 days causing me more money in tolla and 50minutes in additional money. North Lake Dr in Lake Harmony PA exists but not in Google! Instead of giving an error or non-existant message it recommended another address in Lake Harmony 20 minutes away. Then returning on 476 in PA it told me to exit on an emergency wxit only used by E vehicles and Police. The error caused us to go to the subsequent exit 30 minutes out of the way. Of course google has fine print to cover them selves so that they are not liable for their own app glitches and errors... that is how they operate. I am very disappointed. One star!,0,
"How do you screw up one of the great apps ever developed? Ask the geniuses at Google. The map app is now consistently sending me and others to back entrances that are unrelated to the address put into the app. Doesn’t matter if there’s a fence  or wall - google maps thinks you don’t deserve to go to the front of the building anymore. Once or twice? Maybe. But it now is a total crapshoot how close you get to your destination. Oh, and no turning around! You must go five miles out of your way of you miss your turn because it shows up AFTER you pass the street and won’t allow u-turns. An unmitigated disaster for a once proud app.",0,
"GMaps is an essential tool of daily life. But with Apple CarPlay there are some short comings. For example, you should show fuel gauge, outside temperature, or other messages from the car. I see fuel alerts on Apple Maps but not on G Maps. So there must be a way. Also, route finding is a little crazy in cities outside the United States (maybe even within the United States). Can’t machine learning help personalize the experience? Why wouldn’t I be directed towards more optimized routes?",0,
"Overall, Google Maps is useful and convenient. It is precise at tracking traffic, has an automated voice (which sounds similar to Apple’s Siri) which reads aloud which street to turn at, and has a dark mode (A display which turns on at sunset, and sets a screen where your eyes can see more comfortably). The only inconvenience for me is that when I set my home location, I’m someplace else and want to get there fast; I have to type the word “Home.”",0,
"The past two updates have completely eliminated the option of taking the bus anywhere. I live near and work at locations surrounded by busses, and not trains, and Maps now only suggests taking a 20 minute walk to the nearest train station versus just showing me where to take the bus to. I travel around NYC a lot for work, and it’s become so inconvenient and ridiculous that I am having to walk 25 minutes when there is a bus that will leave me maybe 3 minutes from my destination. I rely on Google Maps heavily to get around through it the day, and it’s become so unreliable that I’m not sure what to do in terms of travel now.",0,
"I used to love this app. It was my absolute favorite and I used it more than any other. I’m a regional sales rep and have my accounts starred across three states. Recently stars would just randomly disappear, others would move to a completely wrong location. Other stars I can’t remove. I click on the star and when I pull up the details it shows it’s not starred! So I star it and then it just puts 2 stars on top of each other. Then I un-star it and it’s back to the original one again. I found a workaround online but it’s a pain and what’s the point if I have to go on a computer and can’t fix it from the app?",0,
"What happened Google Maps?  I had deleted iMaps off my Apple iPhone and have used you for years. Now, this latest update has made me question your reliability and accuracy. You routinely show me as being in the middle of fields or water, won't improve the location, and the turn-by-turn directions are now unusable. You're just not the same app as you used to be.",0,
The app is just bad altogether. When using for traffic estimates it’s off by a long shot. You start at a reasonable amount then by the time you reach the destination your about a half hr if not more past the ETA you were first given. Don’t predict an ETA if you can’t get it right. Rather have a set time and arrival earlier rather than arrival hr hour late. Best Maps app for anything as far as Navigating and Traffic is Waze. Don’t waste your time sitting in unnecessary traffic when Waze gets where you want to be at just about the correct ETA it gives you from the get go. Deleted Google Maps and will never download or use again.,0,
"Update: Google fixed the issue and responded to my review, thanks a lot! 5-Star. Original review: Since the recent update, every time I start the app it’s showing me traffic status on the roads - I don’t want to see it, at least not as a default setting every time I’m starting the app. Please fix it. I have to manually turn the traffic status off every time.",1,"Thank you for letting us know about this issue, and your patience as we fixed the problem. We appreciate it! With the latest update, Google Maps should now be working as usual."
"Hands down the best map app. I am constantly haven't contests with my husband, who uses his iPhone default map and direction app. Not only do I get results faster, but they are more accurate.  Always. Once, my husband had a shorter, faster route than google maps gave me.  I was bummed.  When we went his route, we found out the road was closed for snow that season. Ha!  Boom!  Google wins again!",0,
"After this latest update I can clearly see that Google Maps application is using a lot more resources on older iPhones. Once you open it and start zooming out and in to get the view if the whole city you can clearly see that it’s very choppy and freezes at times. There’s clearly a performance issue bug that wasn’t addressed in the new release. Please fix it since it makes application not usable. In comparison native Apple maps are very smooth and is a pleasure to use now. I’ll be switching until Google Maps is fixed. Regards,",0,
"This has ALWAYS been my go to app for navigation. It’s been the most reliable and accurate for the last six or seven years. This new update has changed everything, however. It no longer orients itself with my position and only updates my location maybe every mile or so. Getting directions is absolutely worthless now. You can be on the freeway and miss your exit while the directions are still telling you to leave the Walmart parking lot that was a mile back. I have to unfortunately use Apple Maps :( I’m using an iPhone X so I don’t think the trouble is an outdated phone on my end. Please fix this!",0,
"I recently ordered matching Christmas pajamas for our family.  When received the quality and style was great.  But they were a bit small in most cases.  In my effort to return, I had to email the company.  Their response time was great, and they are issuing me a full refund and allowing me to keep the items to regift!  I will definitely use them again.  Just order one size larger than I think I need!! Thank you Pat Pat!!! Merry Christmas",0,
"After the new Iphone 13whatever update, as a Google Maps user....when I click on address in app.....instead of opening into the Google Maps app like it always does...It opens to the  web version of Google Maps (with a button on bottom that says “Install Google Maps App” with “google maps not installed” next to it. ....IT IS installed.) Minor annoyance but its two extra steps now. Don’t know which app adjustment would fix it..(Shipt, IOS or Google). Mainly seeing if this affects anyone else.",0,
"Are used to love Google maps and it was such a well-made navigation system until about a month ago it started making multiple mistakes every single time I’ve used it. It’s just this week on my commute to my work it makes about three mistakes every single trap from telling me to go straight U-turn and then turn right instead of just turning left, Telling me to turn right and then as I’m turning re-orient the entire screen so that I should’ve made a left adding 15 minutes to my commute because I got stuck in bumper-to-bumper traffic going another direction, to recommending routes that have worse times",1,"Thanks for your review!

"I too have issues with the Google map freezing or in the midst of following its directions , it will reroute me for no apparent reason, which is extremely frustrating when you’re on the freeway or in an area around rush hour. But on the other hand it’s still better than the map that came with the iPhone, it one does miss a turn GM does quickly reroute you and get you back on track ASAP in comparison to the other Map.",0,
"I really like this app, but I would like to see this get supported on Apple Watch. Apple’s Maps app does. I value Google Maps over the Maps app because you can download maps of entire cities and figure out where you are if you’re lost. Of course, it doesn’t give you directions, but I hope directions will also be downloaded with the maps on a future update.",0,
"My husband and I recently purchased a duplex in Crest Hill and were not familiar with the water system the previous owner used. Jason came out and explained everything to us. Being seniors we wrote the information down so that we wouldn’t forget. He was so thorough and helpful, going the extra mile to make sure we understood. He couldn’t have been nicer. Will definitely use this company again.",0,
"This is the app I always use, but recently there is a serious problem, navigating doesn’t work, when I select a destination, the app would not show me the route, I should restart the app for each navigate. Response to developer: when I choose a place and tap the direction, it will show the route for a short moment and then disappears, so I have to restart the app, also I have to mention that each restart will give just one successful direction, so if I want to choose another direction I have to restart again Response to developer: I have already reinstalled the app but the issue is still there",1,"Thank you for letting us know about this issue, and your patience as we fixed the problem. We appreciate it! With the latest update, Google Maps should now be working as usual."
***PLEASE FIX YOUR GLITCHES*** I’ve used this app for YEARS and I’ve been content with it. I personally don’t enjoy the Apple Map; BUT now I HAVE to resort to the Apple Map because this app now has way too many GLITCHES! When I make a turn it doesn’t always automatically show me the next direction to make and gets frozen. I have to swipe left on the directions for it to refresh. When I’m on the freeway it will sometimes think I’m on the street and give me the wrong directions. Sometimes the cursor (blue arrow that resembles me) doesn’t show up at all on the map and I get confused as to where I am.,0,
"In recent weeks, I have had really poor navigation with google maps. The app works fine when the car is standing still but the moment the car starts moving, it appears like the app cannot properly track my location. The arrow doesn’t follow the route steadily, sometimes the arrow points in the wrong direction, and often times the arrow doesn’t know when I have made a turn. Essentially, I am unable to use Google Maps as an effective GPS lately. I got lost on the road at least twice now and I’m running out of patience for this app...",0,
"I Love Google Maps,  I am 68. Not that I can’t read or understand a written map,  I grew up with them , however it is nice to have this type of technology now a days.   Except when she tell’s me my destination , which is my home is on left,  when it is actually on right !!!   LoL.   So it is A good thing. I don’t have Alzheimer’s!!     I really am pleased with Google maps tho. Thx. To all for reading my post or comment.",0,
"I love this app very much, this is definitely my go to whenever I need to take a journey into the unknown, however, I hate the fact that this app does not show me the SPEED LIMIT while I’m driving nor does it show me how fast I’m going. That’s very important information that this app is missing. The Apple Maps shows speed limit and Waze shows both SPEED limit and MpH... its 2018... what the heck man?! Update : 2019 I’ve noticed that Google is in the process of adding the Speed Limit to the maps! Yay!!! Makes me very happy. Thank you",1,"Speed limits in navigation should be available in your country! Thank you for your patience as we roll this feature out.

"I’ve been using Google Maps for years and I’ve occasionally tested it against other navigation apps and it always beat them out. However, lately it has been giving me terrible directions. Just yesterday it gave me one route option through the most heavily traveled road estimating the time at 30 minutes plus traffic. I took another route I knew and I got to my destination in 20 minutes. What is up with that?",0,
"I use this as my main navigation when I’m driving.  I’m extra grateful that the buses and trains can be seen on the map when u ask for time and direction.  Sure there are other apps for that, but one that has many is an incredible convenience! Also would have jumped on a cab if traffic or delays are noticed.  This gives u an estimated cost for that as well!  Very satisfied with this app,",0,
"More than merely a GPS device, it is a phone directory, shopping guide, traffic monitor, car finder and offline map device for nearly anywhere in the world.  I have used Google maps in the Philippines and the United States.  You can even look over a large shopping area and see the locations of various stores while at home.  It is easily the most indepensable app on any mobile device.",0,
"Updated to 5 stars since google maps people fixed the problem within a day or 2 of me submitting my original 3 star review and notified me of the fix.  The previous version saved the last used traffic setting.  The new version doesn't save the traffic setting on, so I constantly have to turn it on when I open the app again.",1,"Thank you for letting us know about this issue, and your patience as we fixed the problem. We appreciate it! With the latest update, Google Maps should now be working as usual."
"Please let maps remember my searches for locations without having to turn on google remembering my entire web search history for everything. Also, now when I search for something and it pops up list view, it's annoyingly difficult to see that on the actual map. If I tap on the address, it tries to share the address rather than showing me where it freaking is on a map. Only way seems, very unintuitively, to press the cancel/back button. What!?",0,
"Honestly at this point Google knows where I live, what I eat, when I sleep, what I like and dislike. Honestly letting them track where I am 24/7 isn't as horrific as it may sound. This app is well optimised. I wish the in app voice was louder but it's good. I appreciate the interface and it doesn't drain batter life and cellular as much as a lot of alternatives. Solid real time updates and calculates routs well. And it's free. Why not.",0,
"I am having issue with google map after updated recently. Now while I am driving on road, google map navigate parallel to me , I mean side of the road.

I love Google maps hands down to! But using maps daily to get around Denver I’m going to have to start using Apples map because google isn’t interacting with the watch. PLEASE bring this back. I assure you there’s a large demand for this!!!!! Also it would be nice if the map could sit on top of locked phone like Apples map does. In a pinch trying to unlock the phone to see the map has made me miss a few turns. I don’t like Apples maps.

Google please make an update to focus on semi drivers. There are times that the regular care route will take semi's down roads and streets they shouldn't be on as far as low clearances and weight restrictions. I have used several trucker GPS apps but I always come back to rely on Google maps. I would greatly appreciated if you would add settings to allow the user to pick their type of vehicle. Then the map calculates the route based on the vehicle requirements. Thank you,0,
"I just installed the latest update and it has left me with a very buggy glitchy navigation.

"I’ve tried several apps to navigate but GOOGLE MAPS is (for me) the winner! Pros: very lovely friendly lady’s voice! Re-routes automatically if you choose to go a different way. Pretty accurate estimating time travel, with some exceptions.. Cons: Sometimes takes me to difficult crosses where there’s a lot of cars traveling and no traffic light. When a street changes name, the app doesn’t tell you, which could be helpful or not. Illegal turns... sometimes...",0,
I love how you are able to add stops and see different routes. While driving I do find it unsafe and annoying to have the navigation suggest an alternative route. In this decision while it can be helpful it will automatically do the alternative route if you don’t click the no thanks button. I do believe this is a form of distracted driving. It would be better or cool if it can be a voice response more than a touch so you can still keep your eyes on the road.((hands free mode)),0,
I think it would be really helpful if the google maps for iPhone had the feature that the desktop version of google maps does. It’s the depart by and arrive by feature where you can select a time you want to depart for a destination or when you want to arrive at a destination. The iPhone google does have that feature for public transportation but not for driving. I think google maps on the iPhone should have it for driving as well.,1,"Thanks for the review.

"So, I created a custom map on my pc several months ago. I used location markers to pinpoint all of the various addresses. There were about 120 of them. The app worked great on my phone until a few days ago when ALL of my location markers suddenly disappeared. The markers are still showing on my PC, just not on my phone. I use an iPhone 7 and have installed the latest update. I have also uninstalled and reinstalled the maps app. Nothing I do makes my location markers reappear. This is extremely frustrating since I travel a lot and need these markers to help me get where I am going!",1,"We appreciate you letting us know about this issue, and we thank you for your patience as we worked on the problem.

Driving to a location then all of a sudden the icon disappears and you are only left with the search icon. No way to get back to actual location and map continues to give the right directions but forgets where you are at. Very annoying and happens a lot. I have full service etc and in the city. The only way to get it back on track is exit current direction and re enter it it in hoping it doesnt do it it again. Why does google maps hate apple so much?  Super annoying and dangerous bug for google maps especially when you dont know where you are going.,0,
"This has been my default Navi for the last couple years. But I think maybe the previous 6 months or so has seemed like a decline. Doesn’t push audio through my car anymore unless I’m IN the app. Disconnects on I’m sad to say more than a handful of destinations, that while on a highway or just not paying attention to every turn or exit necessary becomes quite the extensive delay. The destination time also has become increasingly inaccurate. Would love an update that might focus on a few of those, and not just “general bug fixes”",1,Thank you for your review!

"Two or three things aggravate me regularly about google maps... missing lane information, missing exit numbers and mile markers that appear to intentionally vanish when you are obviously trying to find them!!! Add to these the apps habit of refusing to lock in a preferred path... even  Changing your path BACK TO A PREVIOUSLY REJECTED PATH... Without your authorization... can have you making some serious arguments for replacing your phone after throwing off the nearest bridge. And don’t get me started on the Goat Trails it tries to send me through sometimes... you would think it preferred Residential areas to public highways with working stoplights!!! Well... it is a computer program... and is no smarter than its programming. So irregardless of the aforementioned issues... it is still a mostly usable app... even while needing some definite improvements.",0,
"I am a big fan of google map but it is almost useless on iphone 11 pro. Basically everything seems to work fine for a few minutes after you start navigation. But then it would just stop updating the direction to turn left or right or take a particular road, the voice would also be gone. 100 percent sure it is not gps issue as location dot is still updating and pretty accurate, only the voice and direction to turn left right, etc are stuck with previous turn, so frustrating on complicated intersection. Updating to iOS 13.1.1 also doesn’t help.",0,
Stopped using Apple maps when it took me 10 miles out of my way. Have exclusively been using google. MN has gone hands free so having directions that work is critical. I have a meeting tonight in a location I do not know and went 25 miles out of my way because the server stopped working and would not reconnect. 10 u turns and crossed fingers that the police would not see me using my phone to find where I needed to be and had to use Apple maps 🤮🤐😒😠😡 at this moment I am hoping I can find my way home... server still will not connect.,0,
I use the Google Maps app all the time and the update for the iPhone X to make use of the screen size is great. The reason for the docked 2 stars is a visual issue when navigating. The bottom info is too close to the bottom of the phone where the home-bar is. It makes reading that info harder than before which is an issue for quick glances to see the distances left before the next turn. Google should add a bit more spacing there so that here is clear differentiation.,0,

Just shut up already. Jesus FN Christ. When I’m talking to my wife, and this thing cuts in, I want to kill it with fire. She has to repeat herself over and over.

"Used to have no issues.  Now it doesn't reroute me if I make a wrong turn. Sometimes the length of trip doesn't show up at all. And most recently I'll push start button to start my route and it will not start.  It's like the button isn't calibrated to the touch or something.  I restart, try again, doesn't work.

"I’ve been using this app for years and love it compared to the alternatives. Unfortunately, since I’ve been using it on my iPhone X I’ve noticed constant freezing when a turn is coming up. Not only is this annoying but also very dangerous since I’m having to fiddle with my phone while driving to get it to start working again. My wife tells me she’s having the same issues on her iPhone X. I’m going to have to try using Waze or *gasp* Apple maps until this is resolved. I really hope google resolves this quickly.",0,
"TO ANYONE READING THIS: THIS IS AN AMAZING APP IN 90% OF SITUATIONS. However, when close to a tollway it will often read your location incorrectly and put you on one. If you are in a big city with tolls, I would recommend checking before you leave your location to ENSURE that this “free” app doesn’t screw you out of your money. I would be willing to pay money to make sure this never happens again, because not everybody has the time to deal with BS tollways and their inconsiderate(which should always be expected) workers. People new to large cities can end up in really messy situations because of this; not everybody is raised in the same region obviously.",0,

"As a map app goes, it’s fine, but not an improvement over Apple maps. Ironically, it fails at the very feature that sets is apart, and above, Apple’s map app, namely, street view and photos. Both used to work great, but are now seriously hobbled on the iPad Pro. At least 50% if the time, photos in both features show up jagged, at extremely low resolution. At first, I thought it might be a slow network, but leaving the photo open for 10 minutes doesn’t resolve the issue. No network is that slow, and I happen to have lightning fast internet service in the middle of a big city.",0,
"Ever since I updated to the newest version of the app, it does not recognize any of the public transportation routes near me. It tells me to take an uber to a bus stop of the same route, 20 minutes away... I thought maybe the bus route changed so I looked to see when I could take the train to get to work on time and the same thing happened! The app completely did not recognize the huge train station near me and told me to take and uber to a different train like 15 minutes away. I used to love how reliable and easy to navigate Google Maps was but now it’s completely useless to me.",0,
"I travel a lot. I always carry an atlas and use a map app. Google maps is great at navigation except it (unlike my atlas) cannot or does not distinguish dirt and logging roads from paved roads.

Before you ask the settings are loud, unmuted, and over blue tooth is turned off. Soooo sorry your sick Google Maps Lady?",0,
"I’ve always preferred Google Maps to Apple Maps, but on a recent trip to Washington DC I discovered a feature that drove me nuts.

I don’t know why you don’t get three options to pick from anymore. This only grinds my gears because if you don’t change your setting to “avoid tolls” it puts you in the toll route despite the fact that it is NOT the quickest route.  I don’t understand that.  Also, when I take an exit on an overpass, the gps isn’t sure if I took the exit or jumped on the road below🤦🏿‍♀️.",0,
"I have been given the wrong route several times with this app, changes routes last minute, and gives extremely inaccurate delay times. I was on the Florida turnpike and it told me I was approaching a 6 minute delay due to an accident and told me to reroute to avoid a 6 minute delay. I did not get off of the Turnpike because it is only 6 minutes. Then I hit the traffic and it said I will now be in an hour and 45 minute delay. I was supposed to pick someone up from the airport at 7 PM. Well....now I won’t be there until at least 9 and I’ve been sitting in the same spot on the turnpike for 20 minutes.

"I have used this program for years. I live in the east side of Seattle and have to take some exotic back route every day because google maps will not make up its mind on what way is fastest. Likewise there are many times when I am on a route and it wants me to take an exit then immediately make a U-turn to go back the way I just came. Finally, like this morning when it said I needed to take 405 from Thrasher’s corner to the 520 junction east to Redmond, I got on 405 but then it said a different route was faster. This program is not helpful, nor does it work correctly. Fix it or delete it, but I don’t have time for it..😡😡😡😡",0,
"1st review: 1. Please add a ""Don't Show Me This Message Again."" option in the ""Location Services Off"" message box. Many of us do not ever need this feature and do not want to take the extra step to ""OK"" out of it every time we open the map app. How would you like to tell a door ""Yes! I want to go through you."" every time you tried to open the door? 2. Please add a simple way (as Apple does) to select and remove individual map locations I've searched but will never use again. When I read news reports I use Google as a way to see where the reported action occurred. Thank you. 2nd review: Complaint #1 in my first review seems to be impossible for Google to calculate.  Certainly Google can afford a team of savvy programmers equal to this task.  Perhaps I ought to look up locations I will definitely NEVER VISIT each time this ""Location Services Off"" screen distracts me from my tasks.",0,
"I use google maps quite a bit, mostly to find restaurants that are open at the time I’m using the app. With the new changes I can’t view menus anymore, just amateur photos of food without prices or descriptions. This is not helpful at all. Again, this is not helpful at all. I don’t care what the food looks like but what it taste like and it’s price point. I want to see the actual menu so I can read descriptions of ingredients which I need to know as I often have to follow dietary restrictions due to Crohn’s disease.",0,
I recently took a trip and selected the avoid tolls option. But when I went through the maps the route did not say whether or not there was a toll and since I said avoid tolls I assumed I didn’t have to. But it took me to a toll bridge which cost me $15! I use Waze much more often because it tells me if there are tolls and how much I’m paying for them. This was a huge disappointment.,0,
"I’ve been using google maps forever, and lately there is a completely awful lag time, to the point I’ve missed exits because the map will just freeze and tell me I have like 3 miles still even if it’s down to .2 miles...even when my phone has full bars of service. I guess bright side is I’ve learned to just be more aware of my location at any given time, but seriously I continuously check for updates and they haven’t even addressed this issue. It’s dangerous because I frequently drive in places I’m unfamiliar with and I got misguided once into a wooded area with no service. Please fix!!!",0,
So I have a iPhone 7plus and I have to maps because the phone comes with apple maps installed but I need google maps to use google when I search things which is constantly. Anywho I was searching 1 particular place initially through google maps but when I got to the location it nothing was there but grass and alligators lol then switched and said I was a hour away so I switched to apple maps input the address and determined it took me down a dead end on the opposite of the appropriate address. Long story long lol I’m using apple maps more.,0,
Thanks for being there always when I’m lost and don’t know the my destination... you always showed me the way!! Because of you I knew I’m not lost and never will be..!!!

Now they even have offline version.. so if there’s no internet don’t worry about it at all.. I love google map!!,0,
"Google Maps is the BEST map app IMO! The only hiccup is that I can’t get directions for passes covered by snow during the late fall through late spring. For example, when planning trips to Yosemite, Rocky Mountain National, Yellowstone, and the like you cannot plot directions during the winter in preparation for summer trips. Wish the folks at Google would make a workaround for that, but otherwise, this is my go to GPS and mapping app. Happy traveling!",0,
I had found out about this app by a friend at Grace Congregational Church in Rutland. I happen to love going out to different places to eat and places of interest especially in my home town of Rutland. This is the best app by far to write reviews and track all the wonderful places we all go to in our own hometown of Rutland and beyond. Thank you Google Maps for a job well done. We all appreciate it at Grace Congregational,0,
"This app is without doubt the most useful app I have on my phone today, it’s fast and easy to use and gets me where I need to go. The traffic alerts and flow of traffic guide is just amazing information to have and I use it everyday, also being able to find restaurants and gas stations and get phone numbers all in the same app is great. I can’t recommend this app enough 👍🏻👍🏻",0,
"Today my wife and myself were looking for a new set of mattresses and visited the Mattress Firm store where Jose Rosas work.  There we received a super service and great advice, and responsiveness.  Enough to allow us to get the set of mattress we were looking for.;awesome! Thanks Jose for your wonderful service for the time that you provided to us explaining the different mattresses and for helping us making the right choice.  Thanks for a great product....kudos! José and Carmen Maldonado",0,
"More than 1/3 of my small map viewing screen is covered with the huge map directions / management panel, and there seems no way to make it disappear and still retain the route info. Optimized for very short travel? Pretty useless for those of us who want to use maps for cross-country or inter-state travel. And even with local travel, map view seems frozen rather than adjusting as you move along your chosen route. What are they thinking?? Time to switch to Apple maps--which are much improved in the last few years.",0,
"I use maps mostly to use public transit. When I look for buses to take, I have to rely on previous knowledge to find ones to take. I live in a fairly big city so I am not sure why every time I use the public transit option it only gives me transfers. It has a “fewer transfers” way to order the suggestions, but that does nothing. Often times, it will be a less than 10 minute walk to get to a single bus that will take me all the way home. It is silly that google has a fewer transfers options if it actually changes nothing",0,
"Do you engineer geeks ever actually USE what you develop. Remember, most of us common sense people don’t think backwards or in puzzles like you do. Don’t put too many features into this app. What you think is a really cool feature or idea, is really a complicated, over built disaster that we can’t navigate in order to simply do what maps was designed in concept to do. Make it simple and NEVER change it!!! It worked great 10 years ago!!!!!!!!!!!!",0,
I love being sent on a desert road instead of pavement routes.  I enjoy maps telling me to drive past a place then make a u turn to pull in their driveway. More and more google maps  has me make additional drive time so I get to see routes I would have no need to take otherwise.  All to often I have to say.... no I am going to take my own path... thank you google maps I believe you are devolving,0,
Google Maps is my go-to navigation but like many other reviewers I am frustrated with the latest update that has removed the ability to have traffic always showing. It is now a manual process every time. Not good to have to mess with when I'm driving. Please fix this. UPDATE: Woohoo the traffic layer now stays visible even when I close app. Updated to 5 stars.,0,
"For the past 3 weeks when ever I was traveling to new area google maps would tell me turn left here and go straight, but I wouldn’t hear a thing after that. When I checked I noticed that on the map it wasn’t reading my location at all. I triple checked to make sure that my location was on and everything was fine, and I don’t know why this has been happening. So lately before every trip I would have to memorize the directions before I drove off, I can’t look at the phone while driving so that’s the only option I have. I’ve been having the same exact problem with Waze as well",0,
So one of the most useful features that I utilize while using this app is when I am able to find the best priced gas station along my route when adding a stop. Now I don’t see any rates for gas stations after the update. Please...I really need this feature back... EDIT: Wow thank you google developers for actually seeing my review and taking great care. My issue has been completely fixed! Very pleased!!,1,"Thank you for letting us know about this issue, and your patience as we fixed the problem. We appreciate it! Google Maps should now be working as usual."
"Google Maps used to be my go to for navigation. But recently (the last few weeks) it has been messing up every route I take. The route on the map does not match the directions. For example, my route showed staying straight for more than a mile while the directions told me I would be taking a right in 100 feet. And when I continued straight as the route showed, the directions kept updating to tell me to turn right. There are also key directions missing. The app has failed to alert me of an exit I needed to take on multiple occasions. I was on the highway and the directions said to keep left to merge onto another highway. But what it failed to tell me was that I had to exit the current highway first and then keep left, which resulting in me missing my exit and adding 15 minutes to my route. After having Google Maps mess up my routes for over a week, I have decided to switch to Waze. It is much more reliable.",0,
Please go back to the old version before the update! It’s so annoying how when you click on a city or a country it doesn’t show any facts or information about the place it just shows “local” things to do and pictures of the entire place. All those things are fine but also bring back the short excerpt from Wikipedia that displayed some improvement info about the place you’re looking at!!,0,
"When you say “Stay on highway x or y” why? Just don’t tell us to turn off. You do that too much. I get tired of unnecessary updates every ten miles. Just tell me to stay on the highway for 100 miles, I don’t need 20 mile updates. It’s SO annoying. We come up on a normal stop light and it’ll say “keep left” when what it means is “don’t turn right”. Really you’re saying, keep going straight, but it makes me think I need to fight to get into the left lane for nothing! Please take away the unnecessary “keep left” and “keep right”",1,"Speed limits in navigation should be available in your country! Thank you for your patience as we roll this feature out. To use this feature (once it’s available to you) in the latest version of Google Maps just start driving navigation. In some locations, the maximum speed limit appears as a black and white box. In other locations, the maximum speed limit may appear as a red and white circle. You can learn more about this feature in this Google Maps Help Center article: https://support.google.com/maps/answer/3273406"
"Anytime I’m on the highway, it suggests a faster route. Great! Too bad that the new takes longer every single time with traffic lights. If I do decide to take the new route and make a turn sometimes it tells me the next turn, most times it doesn’t. A new thing it does is go offline and give me a time that’s a half hour shorter, then jumps back to the real time. It’s also started giving me a shorter online time, then decides to add ~10 minutes to it. I didn’t want to do this, but it looks like I’m going back to Apple Maps. Is there honestly ANY turn-by-turn app that’s reliable? Or is that just impossible?",0,
"I’ve been using google maps for years and have been very happy with its performance. However, in the past few weeks it’s performance has gone downhill, it is no longer reliable.  The app has trouble locating me and takes too long to switch to the next set of directions. As much as I hate to do this I have switched to a different navigation app. I can no longer rely on it to take me to new locations.",0,
"This was really the first time I had to use google maps. I’m an island girl from Kauai, so it’s easy to find places there. Berlin is a large, diverse city, and I was able to use Maps to navigate the city on the U-Bahn, buses and more! It made a great time for visiting my daughter, and helped me feel more empowered and independent! Now I’m watching my bus as it nears its destination in Denmark! You guys should when the Nobel Peace prize for peace and  ease of travel!!!!",0,
"I have only used Google Maps for all of my navigation needs for the last 10 years.   Since the update, I can’t trust that it is keeping up and giving me correct directions.   That has never been the case.   My family thought that I was losing my mind when I am telling them turn at the last second.  We use this app a lot when we are traveling across the country with our very large camper in tow.   It is very risky for us to make a quick turn and the app is filled with glitches that puts us at risk.  If I could reset the app to the pre-update, I would be thrilled.",1,Lets give clearing your phones cache and restarting your phone to possibly improve this issue for you like it has for others. More details on clearing cache can be found here:https://goo.gl/GW6uOo.
"The interface could offer a better way to end routes. Otherwise the app runs perfectly. My issue rests with how Google names their apps. Google is such a large, well-known company that it could simply place a “G” prefix before the utility name and it would be more aesthetically pleasing (GCalendar). It’s unnecessary to see Google Calendar, Google Maps, Google Photos, etc. on the same homescreen. Google named Drive... Drive. They could do the same with all of their apps.",0,
I used to really like Apple’s Maps until some idiot updated it so now you can’t get rid of the Favorites pane in landscape mode. It obscures half the map. Now you can never see more than about 1.5 inches of map in either portrait or landscape mode. I guess this is what happens when you legalize pot as we did here in CA. Surely the developers are smoking SOMETHING. This app seems to work very well.,0,
"I have always used Maps with my iPhone,   But recently family was in South Africa for three weeks and we drove everywhere so I decided to try this app. It saved us, even in remote areas around Sun City. We reached our destinations without a problem. In Johannesburg it even suggested alternative routes to avoid traffic. I will now explore this app some more to see what else it can do.",0,
"When you think about how ubiquitous Google Maps has become in our lives, and the depth of its features, you begin to realize: this has to be one of, if not the, best pieces of free software out there. Decades ago, a service like this would have had a steep fee. Now, we get this, and regular maintenance and polish. The new UI is a welcome improvement which is not only aesthetically pleasing but easier to use.",0,
Now that Google Maps is available through Car Play i would prefer it to the Apple Map app while driving but Apple has a few things that Google doesn’t: a companion Apple Watch app and Speed Limits on the screen. I find both of them useful. The Apple Map watch app chimes and vibrates (different sounds for Right and Left etc.) so I don’t have to look at a display to know which street to turn into.,0,
We have a RV Have traveled over 22 states and if you see us out with 100% success rate so easy and I love the fact that it tracks and keeps mention of places we’ve been so I can further comment on them and remember the ones we love and then once that maybe didn’t live up to what we thought but thank you for all the advice and mini more road trips to come❤️👍,0,
"Every new update, designed to give advertisers a leg up and us users slap in the face, this once great app is daring Apple Maps to finally become competent and replace it. It’s horrifying to open this app and see McDonald’s and Jimmy John’s icons all over it for no reason other than a few ad dollars. And I always get to swipe away the “what’s nearby” crap on open. I beg Apple to become competent so I can replace Google Maps once and for all. How they’re going to do that w/o the garbage reviews from Yelp is beyond me, though.",0,
"I used it in familiar routes and often found that Google Maps automatically routes me toward tolls. And I wish I could tell you because it was the faster route but time and time again that wasn’t the case. However, the reason I gave 4 stars was because of how incredibly easy and convenient using this app has been. In one day, I traveled from plane to bus to subway to boat and Google Maps was with me every step.",0,
I favor this app over others until recently. When I go to drop a pin for myself it doesn’t let me label it anymore. This happened after the last update. I work around different locations all the time and I drop a pin and label them accordingly. Now I can’t do that. I have to find a work around and mark places as stars. Sometimes the stars won’t even show up in the stars list. Can’t label the stars with names. This app was so good for what I needed. I hope all this gets fixed. iPhone 8 Plus. If that helps.,0,
I used to love google maps but for a while now it’s had some glitches of not staying on course. For example you’re about to go to your exit then it says something else so you don’t know what’s going on and you’re looking at your phone too much. I’ve tolerated this until I missed my exit by taking a different route google maps put me on and not just ended up being 15 min late for work but also almost got into a car accident and ended up using up extra gas that I could have had for something else. If you value your safety and punctuality DO NOT USE THIS APP.,0,
"Update: Google corrected the issue and traffic on the map is back to working as awesomely as ever! Original: The latest update requires turning traffic on every time you open the app. Seeing as traffic is one of the main features people use the app for, this is a horribly inconvenient feature that needs to be fixed. Once traffic is on, it's a great map app.",1,"Thank you for letting us know about this issue, and your patience as we fixed the problem. We appreciate it! With the latest update, Google Maps should now be working as usual."
"I had this app on my androids my whole life. I switched over to apple and this app does not work!!! Every time I would get directions to some where, the directions/navigation starts somewhere completely different. I deliver for Door dash and on the app I can click navigate and it'll take me to google maps and it never loads. I have to exit and try several times for it to show me the customers address on google maps and when it finally does, the starting point is no where near where I'm at. It will show me in the correct spot, but it'll start from the previous destination. Most of the time.",0,
"I use My Maps to plot directions when I ride my motorcycle. Everything worked fine until the last update. My map will still come up in the Google Maps app but the blue navigation line is missing. I can’t find any info to fix it. I’ve tried restarting my phone, re-installing the app, and trying to download a previous version (apparently Google has made this impossible to do. I tried sending feedback but a pop up appears saying it’s not available in my region. Come on Google, I live in the southern United States, not a third world country. Am I the only one having this issue?",1,"We appreciate you letting us know about this issue, and we thank you for your patience as we worked on the problem. With the latest app release, this issue should be fixed and should now be working as usual."
I went to eat at that fast food restaurant and the manager who was at 9:30 at night served us takeout food when it was to eat at the restaurant and incidentally told us that it was closed for us to leave.  5 minutes later she left the restaurant leaving the employees inside and she left.  many customers went through the car service and did not attend them,0,
"There’s been way too many times where my Maps will not load stating it’s off-line. I am either on WiFi or have service and still cannot connect often. This is an issue when I’m driving in areas I don’t know and it takes 15+ minutes to finally connect online. I hope an update can figure whatever issue this is, because I used to be incredibly happy with this app. Having to use the standard map app on my iPhone too often to get directions now. :(",0,
"I’ve been using this app for years and didn’t have any problems with it it until two updates ago. Now when I look up anything there’s NEVER A PHONE NUMBER FOR THE BUSINESS. Now I have to go to the internet, go to google then retype what I’m looking for just to call a business. Put the numbers back. Every entry on the app says “enter a phone” but when I’m on the internet the phone numbers right there. It’s irritating.",0,
"I like the layout, I like the reviews, and I use it multiple times a day. But it’s extremely inconvenient when the route changes as I am driving. Dangerous, even. For example, I’ll be waiting to make a turn at a light, but GoogleMaps will preemptively decide (at the last moment) that I have already missed the turn and begin reciting a new route that I did not initially choose to take. Be weary of this if you are particular about the routes you choose.",0,
The cta bus information is the worst. The app could be saying that the bus is going to be there in 2 minutes and it ends up getting here after 20 minutes! I am not even exaggerating. The routes it shows to get to a destination are also not very well calculated because there always ends up being a faster and quicker alternative route. I don’t know what algorithm the developers are using currently but I feel like it could be much better. All that said I still use the app I don’t see how I couldn’t I just wish it was better.,1,"Thank you for your review.

"To start, my phone and app are up to date on the latest software. Google Maps is usually my go navigation tool. I’ve removed it and downloaded it again to attempt to fix the problem I’m having. Even with full service it does not recognize where I am or where I’m going. It will jump around from street to street if I’m stopped and then will completely turn me around at the last second. It will not register when I’m moving. I’ve tried to rule out everything that could be the issue: overheating, low cell service, old version of the app etc but to no avail my app is still failing to work and do its job. Hopefully I can use it again in the future but until further notice I will be using something else. My last trip wasted about 1.5 hours of my time due to rerouting in an unfamiliar location.",1,Thanks for your review!

This app was definitely my go to navigation app until some recent updates. Now when I start a trip it will say 1hr to destination when it’s a twenty minute trip. I have to end the route the restart it to fix it. Also it’s been all over the place with correct positioning. Not sure what they did but it’s not nearly as good as it was before the updates. Please fix these issues. I will still use the app but it’s frustrating lately. If these issues get fixed then this would be a 5 star app for me.,1,Thanks for your review!

"Ok so I see they moved the button to switch to satellite view to the upper right hand corner. I like this, makes it more convenient. But then why do they change this method when in navigation mode? now I have to swipe up, scroll down, then hit a toggle switch, then swipe back down again to get back to the map... where’s the consistency? Not to mention this is more dangerous while driving. Why would you make this button easier to find in one view but harder to find in another?!?",0,
I wonder why they keep turning traffic off when you leave the app? It is so annoying to have to turn traffic on every time you open the app. Perhaps you could fix that again with the next update and make sure you leave that feature alone for future updates. This isn’t the first time this happens with updates.,0,
"Whenever I swipe down slightly to view information on store hours, the page pops down so that the image posted is in full view. This interrupts my reading of store hours, as the text that was at eye level, is now at the bottom of the page. Please fix. I want continuous, fluid reading of the page’s information.",0,
"I’ve noticed recently that google maps doesn’t actually bring me fully to my destination. It will tell me “it’s on the left” but doesn’t tell me I need to take a road or turn to get into the parking lot. I end up driving in a circles to get back and pull in where it didn’t tell me originally. I wish there was a good way to suggest that the map was wrong in the app, but there isn’t... there should be a simple way to submit a suggestion where I can write that it didn’t take me where I needed!",0,
"I'm not sure what happened to Google Maps, but it majorly failed me on a trip to Cleveland this past weekend. As in it would tell me to take an exit only to have me make a U turn and go back to take a different one, repeatedly. Setting it to avoid tolls usually works great, but I lost over $20 to tolls on my way home after it randomly decided to reroute me onto the major OH-PA toll highway. It also periodically didn't announce turns so I'd miss them. It was very frustrating, especially since it's usually spot on. I'm hoping it was just a bad update that will be fixed soon.",0,
"Angel View is a great thrift store. There prices are super reasonable and often priced to move quickly. They have a great variety of items. Items such as furniture, electronics, appliances, kids toys, glassware, and of course clothing and shoes. The staff is helpful and friendly. I donate and buy here. Spread the word to donate here. Great place for costumes. They stage the store during certain holidays. I recommend Angel View it is very organized and items are clean.",0,
I love you idiots that criticize a great app like this. An incredible amount of money and work went into its development to get it to the point it is at now. Use it as a tool to get you someplace you have never been before. The app actually will make you stupid. If you didn’t have a smart phone would you be able to find a place with just an address? Probably not,0,
"Love google maps. Use it over other apps. One of the reasons I loved it so much was because it had a subway map view, which I used on a daily basis. The new update has taken that view option away, replacing it with a commute to work/home view that seems pointless. I loved google maps because it covered all of my travel needs without having to download other apps. Now I have to supplement what it doesn’t have by downloading other apps.

"I dont understand why people design with clever, trendy notions yet with no clue what the people really need. Fast, clear, and non complicated! With maps showing most traveled street names and updated information both in new areas along with updated satellite maps. The more clicking you have to do, the more abuse to the neck and fingers. When did it become smart to have to spend double time getting to resources?😜 And why do we have to jump hoops to the third page to find the actual place you typed in?!!",0,
"Update, Oct. 2018: The new update with this “explore” thing is ridiculous. The last thing I want when opening of all things a map app to navigate somewhere is to have to dismiss a pop-up / pop-over prompting me to “explore my city.” No, Google, I just want to get where the hell I’m going. If I want to find new places I’ll....oh, I dunno...Google it maybe? Please revise this app so that “Explore” isn’t constantly in your face &amp; cluttering the app. Awful design. *** This app won't pull info from my contacts on my iPhone?? Update: I dropped this from two to one-star. Other than playing with it for a few seconds, I haven't touched this new Google Maps app. That it won't pull addresses from my contacts makes this app less than useless for me on a daily basis. Apple Maps isn't that bad, but I did prefer the colors &amp; look of Google Maps....I guess I'll just wait until the next update which will hopefully include integration with my idevice's contact list.",0,

Yes, it’s very nice that google at least gives you “map instructions” Incase real time guidance fails but still. This really stings!",0,
"Wow, just like the title says though. I’m even amazed at how badly the navigation can completely throw me off the correct route. It wasn’t as big of an issue for shorter trips, but once I left the state and was depending on this app to get me places on time, all hope was lost. Google, Inc., sirs, guys, ladies, whatever: You have he capability to create a search engine and multiple different apps as standalone productivity tools, but you can’t figure out how to make a blue line appear and stay on the correct route?

"What is with this app lately??? It keeps having a brain freeze while giving me directions and it forgets where I am. I’ll be going straight on the highway and google maps suddenly thinks I’m on a perpendicular road 200 feet to the right. This is extremely counterproductive and I basically have to figure out directions without the use of the app, which is impossible bc I’m using the app FOR DIRECTIONS. Can someone please respond so I know you’re at least aware of this issue and working on it?? I tried deleting and reinstalling. Nothing helps. I never ever had this problem until the update this year. Not good, google. Not good.",0,
"So apparently Google assumes their programs never fail because they don’t seem to offer any way to get technical support. But the latest update of Maps is totally broken. It will start as if it is working, but then it just freezes with the arrow pointing in the wrong direction, and does not progress as I move/drive. If I exit the directions and start again, it will give instructions that were ½ mile behind where I currently am. It is now worse than useless because if I didn’t already know where I was going, I would get totally lost or cause an accident.",0,
"For the past month I’ve had a problem where when leaving home I enter my destination to find the quickest route once I’m on my way I’ll end route since I know my way. Anytime I re launch google maps to make sure I’m still on the quickest route or if there was an accident etc if had my starting point when j originally started from and not my current location. I’ve tried closing the app and reopening and even resetting my phone and nothing works. Very frustrating and inconvenient. Although Apple maps has its own host of issues at this point it’s more reliable, and that’s not saying much!",0,
"I’ve used Google Maps for many years, but it’s no longer helpful. I only get alerts about where to turn if my phone is unlocked and I have the app pulled up. If I go to another app or lock my phone there’s no navigation at all. It’s also gotten bad about thinking I’m on the wrong road (like a frontage st vs the interstate). Sometimes even when I have the app open it waits until the last second to tell me to turn so it’s too late to get in the correct lane. I hope google fixes the issues so I can use google maps again, but if not, I’ll probably delete the app from my phone.",0,
"The most recent update removed my preferred settings and forced me through FIVE tolls. Google maps is great for full map, street view, and reviews. What google maps isn’t good for is updated traffic and construction. Take some pointers from Waze and allow your users to interact more so that other users can know where traffic and construction and road blocks are so you can offer alternative routes. Also, please put out a notice that updates reset your settings!!! NOT COOL!!!",0,
"Google Maps by far is the best comprehensive Ap. Besides GPS, find local restaurants, coffee shops, etc, now conveniently placed. Instant photos, reviews filtered per type, rating, and proximity. No need to search throughout the map. Transit GPS makes alternative routes. GPS is in real time and will allow you to take a faster route. Now available to save maps offline. Many more features!",0,
Almost Everything is out of order witch meaning the fact that when I’m on one street it will skip to another street and the street pictures aren’t even accurate when I’m scoring on one street it would it would look like its skip but it’s not (and I know you just worked on street view for the 2018 year) but in some area like Detroit and any other cities. But at least the quality of it is even better this year :D,0,
"After updating to iOS 12, Apple CarPlay now has the Google Maps app available for the in-dash navigation. While this is a wonderful feature, Google maps now spontaneously stops navigating while en route. This is a showstopper; I expect other users to be forced to switch to another navigation app as well until this can be fixed.",0,
"Pros: pretty reliable Cons: Google maps used to get me from point A to B with zero mistakes. However, lately it doesn’t give voice guidance when you’re close to your destination. I remember it would used to say “in 100 feet your destination is on the left”. Now, it doesn’t say anything and I’ve passed my destination so many times. Also, it’ll mistake you as being on a service road instead of the highway. I’m not sure how when I’m driving 70 miles an hour.",0,
Thank you for responding to Google maps I will be using this from now on thank you for your patience and your time and thank you for responding to every friendly neighborhood Google maps agent and I am in review right now I Google Maps five star rating today because I didn’t even have to open it one time and exactly where I was going thank you,0,
I used to be able to see my saved pin drops and my labeled pin drops actively all the time. Now after this last update it has disappeared. Please make it so I can see all that once again. It really helps me to do my job easier as a truck driver in the oil field! Perhaps you could at least make it optional so the user can visually see them or not see them.,0,
"I’m new to the Katy area, &amp; find some areas difficult to navigate!  I came from the Bear Creek area, had to move since my home was flooded from Hurricane Harvey, and lost just about everything we owned!  Only came to Katy Mills Mall once in awhile, and my husband use to do most of the driving, at the time!  So the google map has helped some to let me know how to get to a place I need to get to......",0,
"Been most helpful for better than my old days of opening a map over the steering wheel “Happy Birthday” far better than trip maps old past. Indicating the lanes available for off the freeway a big plus. Now if only drivers are were more courtesies, I turn on a blinker in LA Freeway what was open lane to the side instantly blocked like a football game. I enjoy the app and Happy Birthday",0,
"The rooms are comfortable, not the best I have stayed in but ok for the price. Pool and spa were not available 😢. I was looking forward to using the hot tub after a long day. I would have given them 4 stars if it was available. Breakfast was average. Staff were friendly and helpful. I will probably stay here again because of the economy. One other thing was it was difficult to find after a long drive and arriving at night. Not so bad during the day when I could see the turn off.",0,
"There has been numerous occasions where 1) Google maps refused to load the correct route (bc they miscalculated my current location); 2) glitched and exited the app for me; 3) froze and made me restart the app 3+ times to get it running properly.I always rely on Google Maps for any sort of bus, car, or walking navigation day-to-day, so it is extremely frustrating in the moment to see my most frequently used app crash this often. I also hate how the navigator arrow never accurately settles my compass in the right direction.",0,
"I switched my maps APP from the IOS mapping to this Google Maps one and it was a huge mistake. The volume is low, and they don’t have more than 2 direction options... making rerouting directions a total mess of time. I traveled in the wrong direction and instead of heading back to where i came from, i drove ALL THE WAY AROUND! A 10 minute drive turned into a 30 minute drive because of course it took me THROUGH the very busy traffic. I’m going back to the IOS one. At least it gives roadside warnings. Be safe driving everyone, hope this helps!",0,
"With one of the recent updates you cannot look through an album to find photos to upload while making a review and this is extremely inconvenient for me as I have thousands of photos and I keep them all organized in my folders, so it would be nice to have this ability back.

I hope one day Google makes an option to set vehicle type and more options. I drive a Class A Truck and Google Maps is highly known to be wonderful for Class C vehicles and B; but only puts you in the vicinity of the place for a Class A. And also takes you on roads and freeways/highways where Class A vehicles are prohibited. Would be 5 Stars but I think Google can do better. Otherwise it’s a necessity more than a great app.,0,
My facial done by Andrea was the best I’ve had in a long line of facials. Andrea is the most kindest women I’ve ever met in the field of Estheticians and the field is large and growing everyday.

You will love her talented works of art of making women feel more beautiful than ever imagined and beyond a shadow of a doubt you will return and find your new Esthetician in Andrea. ❤️,0,
"This app needs a means of disabling the “we’ve found a faster route” alert. The resulting problems are serious: 1) The alerts often come in urban areas while heavy traffic exists. This is not the time for my phone to bark at me to check out an alternate route. Huge safety issue. 2) The feature defaults to accepting the change if not rejected within a short period of time. This adds pressure to the user to take their attention off the road (often during heavy traffic) to evaluate the new route. Huge safety issue. 3) I often plan my route ahead of time with other priorities than speed and urgency. I understand many others do prioritize speed, but at least give me the option to disable the feature. I love this app. I put 40-50K miles a year on my vehicle, crisscrossing the country. I’m a power user.",0,
"App is extremely useful but i can no longer use it after the last couple updates both from google and my iPhone 6.  The app no longer tracks my position when I’m using it.

"Freezes too often on IPhone 7, tells me there is no network and to retry. Meanwhile my other apps are running / downloading no problem. Have to shut down and reopen app. Happens once an hour when I’m using my saved maps under “my places” tab. Stinks Bc I have to use for work as we travel to places on a custom created map.  Again since apple maps doesn’t have this functionality at all, it gets three stars from me.",0,
I don’t know why but for the last six months at least my app has repeatedly been messing up on its ability to show my cursor on the correct road. It makes it quite difficult to discern where I am in accordance to a very complex and busy highway transitions. I have only managed to get it to work by repeated exiting of my destination and then sometimes just wait for it to fix itself which sometimes takes ten to fifteen minutes or so. Even if my phone OS and app is up to date. Very odd and has been frustrating as I’d rather use this app instead of my default phone nav app.,0,
"I generally have disliked Google Maps...UI was wonky and it doesn’t look and feel as good as other apps - ie once I was introduced to WAZE, it was a wrap. But I’ve recently revisited Maps when stuck in the middle of an Indiana cornfield 2 hours south of Chicago with seemingly no way out. Maps connected and got me to Chicago when WAZE was struggling. So, I’m gonna use Maps more often. They need a contemporary look though. It feels / looks outdated.",0,
Google maps on IOS will only open a link in a useless pop-up within the app and the only options that it gives you are to either open the link in Safari or to “read later” or “add to bookmarks” in Chrome. My primary browser is set to Chrome and there is no readily apparent way to change this behavior within google maps. Kind of surprised that Google won’t allow maps to open another google application.,0,
I was looking forward to using this app with CarPlay. Here’s my first impression upon usage. It’s a little tacky. I expected a high quality map to display on the cars screen. Instead to me personally it appears to be a old school navigation you would find in a car with factory navigation installed. I personally like satellite view. Good add on to CarPlay but the quality could improve. Also I would like a feature to turn on and off the traffic data. To me it’s not necessary. It takes up the streets and it just adds too much content. Just my two cents.,0,
"I use favorite markers in My Places for our travels marking where we will go.  An excellent way for directions but now those markers are gone.  Still under my places but that doesn’t help with the ease I once had.  they have disappeared after this last update.  Back to Apple Maps I suppose.  They made it harder now. Update:   Yea!!!   They fixed it, now back to normal.",1,"Thank you for your patience as we worked on this problem.

"The worse and most annoying then Is when your zooming out to look at the map and it automatically tries to zoom in on your location when all I want to do is look at traffic ahead to look for alternative routes. I also do not appreciate how it marks locations I’ve visited and focusing that location as if I’m trying to go again, if I were I would put it in. This again to my original complaint of it automatically zooming in the worse moments making it a inconvenience to use.",0,
"The Google Maps App was once great. It simply consisted of Maps, with reliable Navigation assistance. If I want to see restaurant reviews, coffee shops, movie times, etc.   and other forms of Ads disguised as “helpful information” I know where to look. When launching this app, I simply want to know how to navigate across town as efficiently as possible. Luckily- competition has made gains, and I find that (the once inadequate) Apple Maps providers better experience for me in most situations.",0,
"This business is very fraudulent. I sent in a large number of boxes of test strips and didn’t hear from them. I waited a full month. It was very difficult to get thru on the phone so I went to web page. Believe me when I say very, very misleading web site. They were not fast, no payment at all, and when they responded to my email, promo side to take care of payment ASAP. A week later I sent new email and they said I was t in their data base. I have sent tracking number, address and phone number but no response, DO NOT use this company! Chances are high I will not get paid!! Very poor way to do business.",0,
"Honestly I have no complaints. Google maps is by far the best navigation app, easily out-ranking both Waze and Apple Maps. Location, navigation, and speed limits are almost always accurate. The only thing I could think to add is an option to show your current speed limit, but I wouldn’t even remove a star for it.",0,
I depend on this map all the time regardless if I know where I’m going. Like to plan my next first time visit at a place or just check out what others think and the pictures are not as fancy as instagram but it shows the best pictures and I’d say 90 percent of the time the maps are updated or current.  Most of the places I want to are marked so I have a good selection.,0,

"I have been using google maps instead of Apple maps on my iPhone and via CarPlay ( for my gig economy job mainly) and ever since updating to iOS 13 (and 13.1.2 currently) the map whether in satellite or default mode will just show blank spaces with my gps icon over them where the map normally would show details houses, roads, foliage, etc. I even have my whole zone downloaded to offline so I know it’s not a connection issue. Please help!!",0,
"We were heading to a store that was pretty far from our home, so we decided to use maps to look for the directions and entrance. We were about to enter, when the gps told us to enter though a blocked off area, labeled “Authorized Vehicles Only”. It kept telling us to go through the restricted entrance, but we eventually found another legal way to enter. Minor direction issue that could’ve caused us a hefty fine",0,
Topical geography in motion allows me to see what landmarks and landscape surround me while traveling to unfamiliar locations in my set route.  That’s a HUGE plus for me!  The addition to traffic route congestion hi-lighted in colors of orange and red when utilizing navigation is an awesome automatic feature.  That feature alone can stop an accident.  I hope some day it’s introduced in open range driving... that would be nice.,0,
"This used to be the best of the 3 driving-direction apps I use. Now, I can’t trust it. For example, I missed getting on to an unfamiliar freeway because the app decided my car hadn’t moved for the last miles even though the app window itself was moving with me—the blue car icon was still stuck back at the convention center. Or, very common, it decides I have magically teleported one or two blocks to the side, and starts the give me directions from there for a minute or two.",0,
"When the network drops on WiFi and I switch to LTE the says to “offline - touch to retry” except the function doesn’t work. You have to force close out of the app and restart it for it to function. Another issue related to navigation. Google maps doesn’t recognize time constraints for left turns. Specifically Phoenix, 7th st and 7th ave. These streets have had these rules for going on 30 years and Apple maps does it correctly, so what’s your excuse Google?",0,

"Dear developers, If I may make one suggestion to the app, it would be make the option to pick a default for ‘Faster route available’ prompt using a menu configuration. Currently it defaults to ‘accept’ after the timer which may work for some drivers and not for others, and for those who don’t to accept the suggestion, it is unwise to take the eyes of the road to touch ‘Reject’. Thank you.",0,
"OK, I generally love Google maps. And I use it all the time. BUT-  who on earth decided to put little preview box in the bottom left corner of the map???! In the exact spot where you put your left thumb to zoom up zoom back, or move the map!!! So of course, every time I go to adjust the map, I hit that little box and it then goes to a window with a preview, which I don’t want. Ridiculous!! If you’re going to put a preview box, put it in the top left corner. Yes, I would like to give Google maps a much higher rating. But I want to emphasize how stupid this additional new feature is.",0,

Drive for Uber and I have an IPhone 6plus and with google maps it has latitude longitude coordinates instead of the actual address when reaching my destination.

"Love this act most of the time, however , where is the ability to choose my route? There are times that your routing may be the shorter route but I cannot use it because it is a two lane instead of an available four lane route and I have eye problems and need a better road. Case in point is your routing from Montgomery Alabama to Panama City Beach Florida I use Highway 231 and this app doesn’t give me that route. Let me route myself please.",0,
"I’ve used google maps for years.  It was always useful.  Something has changed.  I just used it on a multi state and Canada trip and feel the app is getting worse.  Telling a driver to take an exit in the left lane in a 70 mph zone with no more warning than a quarter of a mile before that exit is unacceptable.  And, not speaking in tough situations is unacceptable.  I’ve seriously considered deleting the app from my phone but am in constant hope that the improvement will come in the next update.

Of the beaten path can be nice. But this thing went overboard in wales. Almost cost me a rental car.,0,
I have used google maps almost from the time it was released. Since the inception it has been by far the only reliable map app that I used in every time I have the need to get to a place quick and reliable directions.

The GPS position accuracy and responsiveness has degraded significantly after upgrading to iPhone X (and ios 11.2). It takes several seconds after taking a turn for the new position/orientation to become updated. It's as if the GPS is a few seconds behind when in Google Maps. The GPS position is also very inaccurate where it suddenly misses the fact that I'm driving on an overpass and recomputes the route from a position hundreds of feet away. Both Waze and the default Apple maps don't seem to exhibit this.,0,
"Google maps has been great and useful many times for years. However, lately I have noticed that it becomes frozen at my home location. An example is, if I am at my college and need directions to get to somewhere it will tell me the directions from home to get to the destination.

"I regularly deal with KML with paths, markers, and polygons. For a while, more or less, the app has been reliable loading up My Maps places and showing them without too many issues. Now, when I load up a map, it struggles to render it all. Zooming in and out causes random paths, markers, and polygons to become visible or invisible and it’s wholly inconsistent. It’s not slow internet. I verified this over several days over several locations and everything else works just fine. Speed tests come in on an average of 30 Mb/s, more than suitable for loading My Maps. I would like for this bug to be addressed. Other than this glaring issue, I’ve not had issues with Google Maps but as I rely heavily on imported KMLs, this negatively affects the usability for me. Thanks for looking into this in advance.",0,
"I’m extremely glad to see google maps integrate the popular waze features. I notice that while using navigation solely through my phone- the reporting option is there. however, when I use carplay the feature is missing. not sure if they need to update the interface or maybe there is a setting that isn’t turned on. only reason why i dropped one star",0,
"I love using Google Maps, it’s my #1 choice in navigation and GPS. However, recently when I attempt to search things up, it always displays that there are “no results.” For example, I’ll want to route myself to a Taco Bell in my town, and I’ll search it up, and it will tell me there are no results. I do love using this app very much but this glitch has been sort of irritating as of late. Otherwise, this app works like a dream.",0,
"Love this app! Perfect directions during the most crucial times! Really appreciate that you can receive and report interruptions in the flow of traffic. Also love that they use landmarks as well as distance especially because you may not always be able to see a street name but you will see a “landmark/ business, such as arco, Burger King etc. many thanks",0,
"New research shows that Google apps track and store your location even when you’ve selected the option not to do so. Google explicitly states that turning off location services and turning off that feature will prevent this, and now we know this to be false. Google is also helping China commit humanitarian offenses. You used to stand for information freedom and privacy, Google. Now you’ve become the antithesis of those thing. You’ve become the world leader in the things you stood against. I’m done with google all together. I’ll stick to Apple Maps, Waze, Bings, etc.",0,
"App has its ups and downs, but the what drives me mad is the flawed gps position. when I place the directions the arrow is pointing to go forward but when I start driving the arrow spins around and points the opposite direction. Another issue is when I start driving the gps goes on a fritz and doesn’t pin down my exact location. It pin moves around the block or neighborhood streets and I end up missing my turns before it works properly",0,
"Very nice turn by turn GPS driving directions with a clear, natural sounding voice. Unfortunately, interface is unintuitive in many ways, with cryptic icons replacing labeled buttons. For example I still haven't figured out how to find businesses near a location I want to go to rather than near my present location. When you type in the search field, it misses a great opportunity to show you your recent search history, instead just presenting a blank screen.",0,
"This is not a one star for the app in general but the current version, the favorites and want to go points all disappeared!!! Took me years to add all the place, please fix ASAP!

"I use google maps daily and for the most part I love it and how you can add multiple stops and route your day for the most efficient way to run it.  My only big request is maybe try being more trucker friendly.  You have options like transit for walking, bus and car but nothing for semi trucks.  Other then that it’s great.",0,
"Thank you for supporting transit navigation in my current city, Vienna, Austria. Unfortunately Apple Maps doesn’t think this city to be necessary it’s efforts. Though the big thing I’m missing here is a Google Maps Apple Watch app. One that tells me what tram or subway to take and when to change lines. Especially when I’m stuck in a busy train, I can’t always easily reach for my phone in my pocket but a gaze on my watch is always possible. Thank you.",0,
"I just completed a multi-state trip and I love the addition of the speed limit to the display, but would prefer that it is always there, not just the seemingly random times it appeared.

"When i first started using Google Maps, it used to be good years ago. Now with all the updates the app has gotten worse. I can’t customize my route like i used to (if i can remember correctly). It also at the top of the screen will have old turn directions still stuck so i have to continuously shut down and reopen the app to get it to update. It seems like more frequently my arrow will be spinning around in a circle, on a road that im not on, or will have me somehow traveling backards.

I continue to be amazed at the quality of this App for giving me the correct directions to places that I want to drive to. It gives me precise directions and alternate routes to follow to the point that I desire to go to. It also gives me the time that it will take me to arrive at my destination. I would highly recommend it to everyone seeking an App to use for a guide.,0,
"The application want you to know the direction you are going, before been navigated. This should not be the case. It is very slow at first in directing, shortly after you entered the address to where you are going. Sometimes, it takes you to the back of the address you are going. Above all, it is still the best GPS around.",0,
"I live in a rapidly growing area of Southern Idaho-the Boise area.  We are currently building a new home, and our street and street address is “not found” each time we search for it using Google.  It is in Apple Maps and other navigational searches, however... The subdivision has been in existence for five years.  My new street  has been around for just as long.  Please update Southwestern Idaho soon!",0,
"Half the purpose of a map is to find things, towns, roads, etc. and this app does that very poorly. Extremely low contrast colors makes lesser roads very hard to see and labels on roads and towns don’t show up until you are zoomed in so far you can’t see around the area you are looking. Outside of a city, you often are looking at a screen full of almost nothing that you wind up zooming in and out and in and out. Please, Google, at least give some options for higher contrast color schemes and higher levels of displayed detail.",0,
By far Google Maps is the leading navigation app. My one issue: I personally try to self navigate without using turn by turn but find it difficult to know street names because some of the names don’t appear unless I zoom out or move the map view over. It would make sense to have the street name right at the intersection in smaller text. Kind of give it look/feel of real street signs.,1,"Thank you for letting us know about this issue, and your patience as we fixed the problem. We appreciate it! With the latest update, Google Maps should now be working as usual."
"For one, get lost or at least spend twice as much time getting from point a to point b. Google not only gets you directly to your destination, it also uses weather, traffic congestion, road work, you name it.

They even touched up on the little road chips anywhere they found them and give me a small bottle of paint for future touch ups. I would give them a thumbs up and say when the need comes I would not go anywhere else to even compare their bid. I hope I will never need a bodyshop again, but if I do, I go straight to Fixed Auto.",0,
"I used to love this app and was my go to GPS and navigation app. We have 2 separate custom maps we have saved and use as a trucking company for places we go to a lot. The last 2 times the app has been updated my maps disappear and I need to reload on the app. Also, since the last update, the app freezes every time I want to check mileage between to points. I choose a destination, and then when I select choose point on map instead of current location, the app stops running!! Very very frustrating!",0,
"Used to be good , stopped being reliable over a year ago! Blue dot is almost always off to the side of where I actually am, on a different (INCORRECT) road. It’s a good thing I have to use paper maps and hand written instructions for work (often in remote locations in nature), or I would have ended up trespassing if I relied only on Google maps for instructions! The only time it shows me in the right location is if I am not moving for awhile, in a city. Get it together Google! You are putting people in danger!",0,
"Hazard reporting options are not available on the infotainment screen of Apple CarPlay. You literally have to unplug your phone and use the phone’s touchscreen if you want to report a hazard.

"It baffles me that this app can be off by half an hour to an hour EVERY SINGLE DAY I GO TO WORK. How hard can it be to adjust your algorithm if it gets the estimated time of arrival off by THAT much every day. If the traffic is ALWAYS heavier than your algorithm says it is, your algorithm is flawed and I can’t imagine it to be that difficult to tweak for a tech company such as yourself. Also, if I start heading west at the beginning is a trip, it changes the direction I am facing  about 2-3 times before it gets it right about 1/8 of a mile later. What’s up with that?",0,

"I wanted a map that was so detailed and updated that it could give me a way to each of the buildings in my college.

"When signed in to your Google Account on any iOS device, the search function in maps is broken. An error prompt appears saying “There was a problem with that suggestion.

Very unfortunate as Google Maps has been my go to for years. Will be switching to Apple Maps and Waze for the time being.",0,
"Lately, not sure what it is but the app has gone ape ....   it redirects on its own while I’m in the middle of my route on a highway just because it thinks I’m close to an exit, even when I’m on the suggested route it provided initially, it keeps spewing out re-routes and different directions which is not only confusing but dangerous because it makes me second guess and have to check to see if it’s an error I made or not. How is it that hard to fix an obvious bug? I’m not the only one experiencing these issues. I used to love it then a few updates ago, it’s gotten progressively worse.",0,
I’ve sent emails two times through the app and had no response. The app crashes on me at least one time per day. This is problematic as I use Google Maps for my job and I depend upon it .  It may have something to do with compatibility with iPhone X. There was no problem until I switch phones. Please fix the crashing issue. The map also turns itself off and just stop navigating. Sometimes I won’t notice until I have  Driven well out of my way.,1,This is an issue we hear about from time to time.

"This App used to be my preferred app for checking traffic and being the most reliable app for getting me where I need to go. Then a couple of months ago, it started to cause my phone to freeze each time I used it and when I tried to go to App Support, I was unable to post anything. No good articles on resolution came up. So, the app is not only having issues within itself, but causing trouble for my phone and Google hasn’t provided a good way to find a solution.",0,

How come google maps can’t change a road description for 3 years when they got it wrong in the first place. They have a road assigned to private property but won’t change it. I invited them to come out and I would personally show them the road corrections but they have not came around at all for the last 4 years that I have complained about there screwup. Can they get it right or not. Not so far yet,0,
"This app used to be a gem, but somewhere along the line, it got an update that has rendered it all but useless for travel while driving. The GPS freezes in one spot and doesn’t move no matter how far you go. To make matters worse, unless you’re looking at the phone the whole time, you won’t catch on as the voice assist no longer functions.

"My Google Maps app has always worked great in the past, it's been an amazingly convenient app to have and I've loved it. However for the last month or so my app keeps somehow going offline and saying it's not connected to the internet. Everything else on my phone works completely fine and has no issues pulling data.

That being said, I just downloaded the app update and they have taken away the business hours in the info section when you search for/click on a business on the map!!

I hope they update it soon to add it back!",0,
The accuracy has definitely improved over the years. I have been a loyal user since 2002. So I have seen this app since it’s conception.

"The latest version doesn’t provide the shortest time routes. As an example, coming south from Denver on I25 which showed a 15 minute red/delay. No other route option was given, not even the back way.   Took the back way anyhow and it ended up being 5 minutes faster. Oh by the way, Google Maps froze once I went my own way (a regular occurrence now).  Strange, Google Maps was happy to provide longer time options after this delay (but none before to detour the long delay).  What I need is shorter time options,  it longer.",0,

I go to a therapist once every two weeks. It’s the same place in the last year. Not only does this app take me the wrong way the first time but I have to constantly check it on the way to make sure it didn’t change my route. For some reason it likes to take me in the wrong direction to a whole different address halfway through. I’m done with this app and it will be deleted as soon as I get my addresses out of here...This app is going to waste of my time literally and aggravating as hell tells me wrong exits to go off on and that certain roads aren’t there.,0,

The app had been working great up until recently when I put in a destination and start my route the pointer doesn’t even move. Just basically shows I’m sitting still making it hard to tell where I’m going. It doesn't guide me anymore and cause me to miss roads. When I used it today I got lost because it showed that I was in the woods somewhere and never did it show me how far my road was. I thought maybe deleting the app and redownloading it would work so I’m hoping it does but after reading reviews I see I’m not the only one with this problem. This is an issue that needs to be reviewed.,0,
UPDATING my response per Google to give details of the issues I am experiencing. The new update needs IMMEDIATE IMPROVEMENT. Ditto to the many recent reviews regarding the update. The app is so terrible now. Please repair. I live on this app.  The following are the glitches which come to mind right away. The navigation arrow does not update my location if I pinch or pan the screen to view. The navigation icon also does not update my location if I miss a turn or directions. The navigation directions are super sketchy. It is sending on a rabbit chase instead of a clear path of direction. The MPH never shows up on the screen. The nighttime navigation never changes. While using in busy greater metropolitan areas like Houston Texas the navigation simply flutters and flickers and does not update nor do I have any clue where I am going.,1,Sorry to hear about this issue! Can you please tell us a little bit more about what you're experiencing so we can investigate further?
Does what it is supposed to quite well for the most part. I wish it would learn that I always want directions and take me right to them without so many button clicks. There is an add on to this app which is supposed to give you instant directions home. Sometimes it starts taking me to Home Depot or some other place with the word home in the title. A ridiculous flaw that causes huge inconvenience sometimes. Be warned.,0,
"I use Your product all the time and love it but I do have a question. My subdivision is about two years old, the street I live on is not named correctly.

"Love google maps, have been using it for years. It’s especially useful when you can’t find your way back home.

"When I put an address in it goes directly to turn by turn and won’t show mapping directions. If I turn the phone off and back on it occasionally might fix it but it’s only happened once where it was fixed. Eventually, it went back without touching the screen! Please repair this issue.",0,
"With many roads out because of flooding during hurricane Florence we depended on Google maps to get us safely home.

"Google maps is the best app out there for directions. That being said, it’s actually sad that one has to settle for what it offers. I’m one of those people who have to see the exact turns onscreen to have a smooth driving experience. For example, the map will say turn left but on the visual it points to the right. (I don’t know if I’m the only one who has this issue) but it forces me to rely solely on the voice directions rather than what’s on the screen. This makes me a bit nervous when traveling especially when approaching a turn and I can’t see the street signs anywhere.",0,
"Lived by this app all over the country. Never let me down, until now. I have hundreds of saved places, never had a problem, until now. They keep disappearing. I’ve uninstalled and reinstalled a couple times but my saved places eventually disappear. I know there’s a limit to how many you can save so I parr’s it down, didn’t help. Other than that it’s a great app. Hopefully it gets fixed soon.",0,
I get the tools that I need for the most part and it has always worked well when I’ve needed it. I just need one thing. Please add overall miles for each stop. If I have 2 stops I’d like to know what the distance was between stop 1 &amp; 2... then from 2 to 3. I log the distance for work and I have to go to the website to get overall distance instead of having to rely on the app when I’m mobile.,0,
"I can say that I appreciate google maps, for one reason I was using another app for my road trip came across some road construction on the 10; and did you think the app send my on an alternate route?

"It’s definitely time to stop making “improvements”. The app has been the best out there for many, many years. Now it is starting to be degraded by those who think the can always make something in their own image which must be better than before because it’s new and different. To those people I say “make your own app”.",0,
"The app has been going down hill over the last couple years. Results are less and less accurate. Navigation is also getting worse. For example, it can navigates you backwards or can’t do the first half a mile of navigation from where you are. Often it can’t understand a complete address and will change the result to a different city, sometimes 300 miles away. I use it all the time and see that these issues are not resolved but continue to get worse.",0,
I absolutely love google maps. I feel like it’s especially best for public transportation. But lately when I look up directions to anywhere it tells me that it can’t find a way there.

Before today I would definitely give Google maps a five star easily but was very scared this morning when my arrow indicator started pointing backwards and on the highway realizing that the whole map was upside down. I thought it was my phone so I closed it and started it again but it was still happening. I hope this is not that this was truly a scary experience and was late for my first day by almost a hour!! :(,0,
I’ve looked all over but haven’t found the option to repeat the directions like in the iPhone apple maps!!!!! There you can tap the top portion and it will repeat directions from where you are at the time you tap!!!!! I’m afraid i’ll have no other choice but to go back to Apple Maps unless this option is added! I almost passed my destination because I was unable to hear the directions until it was too late. Please fix this,0,

"Google Maps was my favorite GPS, until a few months ago. The recent app versions are unreliable and give confusing directions, like indicating an upcoming turn because the road veers a bit in that direction before actually needing to turn in the opposite direction. Causes me to be in the opposite far lane from the lane I should be in. On top of that, it frequently recalcs/reroutes, sending me in circles  or no apparent reason. My lousy Subaru onboard GPS is currently better than Google maps. I’ll switch back to my Garmin until Google sorts this out. Not usable as it is.",0,
"CarPlay needs a lot of work, can't believe it but Apple Maps is actually much better. The following needs fixed: (1) remove all the traffic except for the road you're driving on. It's just visual clutter and makes map hard to read. (2) stop cutting out music when updating directions just lower volume. (3) calm down with the constant chatter,  need far fewer nav updates. (4) something is wrong with the GPS, it's far less accurate that Apple Maps when driving thru city rerouting way too often.",0,
"Google maps does not accurately reflect closed roads, which is when you need the app the most. In traffic, it often reroutes you to closed roads because there is no traffic there, causing even longer routes than if it didn’t. It won’t let you explore different ways to get to a location if the way you were going suddenly has heavier than usual traffic. I actually called someone from the road to have them explore options for me from a computer because the app was no help (although it is better than iOS maps).",0,
this new update made the app very hard to understand and once you get the hand of it it doesn't show when the busses will arrive(I use it mostly for busses) which makes me wait longer or maybe it shows somewhere where it can’t be found. please fix this problem. thank you and looking forward for your response.,0,
"The App no longer had the one feature I used every day, the driving tab that was on the bottom that allowed me to choose from my saved locations (work and home). Now, instead is this stupid Explore feature at the bottom that I could careless about. I used to be able to select work or home with one click after pulling up the App. Now it’s more laborious as I have to go in and start searching for the locations each time instead. Very frustrating!

"Simple suggestion for 2019 I believe google can do way better than most of these apps and it comes to my maps google brings. Should be able to have a way better quality view of the map. As far as the animations ,  you guys do a great job when it comes to the 3-D view also the map needs to be more accurate when it comes to taking shortcuts doing traffic jams it should be more alternative routes and just 2 or 3 Especially if it personally and get off the highway , the map route different alternative route But anyway there’s always room for growth",0,
"Worst update EVER. While driving the arrow doesn’t follow my direction and when I touch the compass it goes reverse. It tells me to turn, so I turn, and 5 minutes later it still show the same turn to take. It doesn’t give me more than one choice for the road. I went to a 8 hour drive, I set the map to avoid scenic route but after all the BS it still took me to a scenic route, and i got lost twice because of the BS turns. How can I get to the version before the update?? I only gave it 1 star because it gives the option to save where you park, otherwise it would have none!!",1,Are you still experiencing this issue on the latest version (4.41) of Google Maps?
"After trying out several map/GPS apps on our iPhones over the years, we've come to depend on GoogleMaps most of the time, for around town, during heavy commute traffic, and on long trips.  However, it sometimes is stupid &amp; doesn't offer obvious alternative routes that we know to take- which some other gps apps do suggest (resulting in my having 2 apps open at the same time... )",0,
I think it’s awesome of Google to give the opportunity to use this useful map tool and I’ve found its more correct with the information than all the others. I live in the National Forest so getting lost out here is easy but with Google if I’m in a wi if spot which is rare but becoming more and more available it’s a big help to find your way back home. Thanks Google!! 😊,0,
"I have been exclusively using google maps since it became available. I recently tried Apple maps just to see if it has improved and pretty impressed by some functionalities (speed limit, clear and more focused lane watch, next exit in big bold letters etc). Please google focus on these areas. I don’t mind if the actual map area is smaller to accommodate these important info while driving.",0,
"Although I have been mostly impressed over the years using this, more and more lately I’m getting bad directions as per the title of my review. It’s getting to the point where it’s ridiculous and could cause me some trouble. It has certainly taken me to a location where I was directed to make an illegal turn and turning around to go the right way added considerable time to my trip.",0,
"So the issue of being able to grab the grabber bar on the iPhone X has been resolved, but now I have a new issue. I use the feature of planning a route which usually involves 4-7 stops. After I plan my route, it’s not safe for me to leave the maps app and come back because it erases my entire route except one random stop. So frustrating to have to re-enter my entire route because I chose to leave the app. Please fix this ASAP. It’s my favorite feature",1,"1/19/18 Did this resolve your concerns? 12/14/17 Thank you for letting us know about this issue, and your patience as we fixed the problem. We appreciate it!

I've used google maps for a while and have had no problems. Now when ever I try to get directions it shows me the route for two seconds then disappears. So frustrating! Especially because I have recently moved to another country and this has been my main way of getting around. Has this happened to any one else? Is it going to be fixed anytime soon?,1,"Thank you for letting us know about this issue, and your patience as we fixed the problem. We appreciate it!

I was driving my truck suddenly the front wheel came off!   Yea.  Really. It bent over and lodged under the truck.   Tom at Sheena said I was lucky I want going fast.  I had the truck towed to Sheena and they fixed it.  Loved the work and service and the fact I am safe after that experience.  I wholeheartedly recommend sheens auto body and repair. I’ve been a customer 20 years.  Pete,0,
"Overall great mapping app. However, with the recent version, if you close the app and restart it, the Map Details reset to Transit. Quite annoying to have to re-select Traffic every morning and evening. In addition, would be nice to have the option of displaying plus and minus buttons on the screen for zooming in or out. Having to pinch-to-zoom while driving... not the safest action behind the wheel.",0,
"Ever since the new update, maps switches the layers views (transit, traffic, etc) without asking you because it is tied to the new mode feature. Sometimes, for example, it shows traffic layers and automatically when you start navigating, and I hate that because you can’t even change it back without exiting navigation.",0,
"It’s nice that you take the view and show me the delay ahead, but could you put the view back where you found it? I like to keep it zoomed out for those long road trips. And you guys just love zooming in to show me 1/4mile of what’s ahead of me, you know, exactly what I see looking out the window. I don’t need maps to see what I can see in front of me. Also if I decline the detour once, twice, thrice... stop asking me about it. Would be nice to revive a notification when a closed road is reopened. Weather closures and openings can be timely.",0,
Ever since the most recent update I cannot search for places on a map. It just gives me a list of places but doesn’t show where they are on the map. Why would I care to go through a list of gas stations and their ratings when I can’t see if they’re on my route?? I can’t believe I’m doing this but I’m going back to Apple maps. At least there I can find out where the last gas station is on my road trip.,1,"Let's give clearing your phones cache to possibly improve this issue for you like it has for others.

"So, i took your advise Google, and the place where i live now actually shows on the map where i am. Before it was showing that i was living in the center of a Lake..lol! But it corrected itself.

The latest version of the app no longer has a feature that I thought was very useful and informative. The app no longer updates the estimated time remaining to arrive at a destination as you travel.  Now it only gives you the estimated time to travel the original route.  That time is displayed and does not change as you travel.  Please restore the old feature!!!!!,0,
Used to be the best but with the new “truck” update instead Of the arrow it’s horrible.  I hate the truck and it lags horribly when you have to turn.  It Takes a while to catch up to your location and by then it’s too late to know if you’ve made a wrong turn.  Instead of telling you to turn around it takes you 5 miles out of your way to get back in track and even then lags and doesn’t direct until its caught up to your location and again leaves you on the wrong route.  Really irritating and I will be looking for a new app.,0,
"There was a time when the map would face up, and all you had to do was follow the arrows to turn left or right. Some genius then decided that the map should swing all over the place, depending on the direction of north. Even if you select the option to not point to North, it doesn’t make it simpler. Another gripe is when I start the map, and the app tells me to “head North”, or south or whatever; how exactly am I supposed to know what direction that is? I don’t carry a compass with me. Bring back a simple interface, pointing in a fixed direction, and just tell me where to turn and when.",0,
"This app is amazing for always trying to use the fastest route to get one to their destination, however, the app doesn’t account for the number of people in the car. Some routes may be faster than others because of the use of the HOV lane that google maps doesn’t account for. It would be great if there could a be feature that accounted for this so that the route destination time may be more accurate.",0,
"Often times this app will take you around the block to right where you started from. Really. That is not very convenient when you are in the country. It will take you on all kinds of back and forth directions that make no sense and take lots of extra time. No one can get to my house using this app. My street is not even on the map. It will take you to lane, road, drive, ave, but not court. Useless. I have tried to get this fixed but the standard forms do not let you accurately report a problem. Maybe this horrible review might help.",1,"Thank you for your review! Sorry to hear about this issue.

"Always a pleasure working with google maps, and saving valuable time. I wish my requests for points of interest were considered legitimate. Seems they always get disregarded by the authorities. Some places are locally significant, and Google should rely on input from potential ground truths. I’d be very lost without this app though, it’s truly a gift. Finding oneself around, old school (with a hard copy map) is soo slow.",0,

I like google maps but their needs to be some updates.  I’ve ended up at the airport twice.  The first time I ended up at the airport was for Papadeaux Seafood and the second time was for the Salt Lick Cellars.  We live in a digital age that relies on feedback right?  Google maps will inform you if a business is closed before you set it for directions.  Why can’t it notify you that your destination requires TSA?  It’s bad enough that I have wasted my time driving but now I’ve missed out on two places to eat.  Get together google.,0,
"Does anyone else notice this app getting TOO optimized? Like, maybe because it is one second faster to drive through a neighborhood, it will route you through one instead of just staying on a major route? It doesn’t account for the left turns, merging, stop signs, tight turns, and more stop signs in the neighborhood.  I sincerely doubt it is faster most of the time, and if so, only by a few seconds. But TRIPLE the hassle! Not to mention I feel silly for having done all that! Of course, I follow maps blindly, fully trusting it to be all knowing, which it easily proved to me after the first series of Garmin GPSs embarrassed me. This is most prevalent right as I near the destination. Traffic, tolls, ferries, etc... do not enter into the equation here.",0,
Slow to reroute but then wont provide a new route when a road is closed. Will make you go in circles then you have to drive a mile out of the way of its intended route before providing you with a new route option. Just got stuck in an hour worth of traffic due to construction and road closures even though google maps said my route was clear prior to leaving (via the new “commute” tab). I drove just 5 min before getting stopped in standstill traffic. Could have been avoided if the app just warned me to use another route. Thanks google maps,0,
"Google map is my first choice, but lately it start forcing me take longer route because longer route consists toll road. It happens in the past but today it completely blocked the option for the other routes even though I have set to avoid toll. I am going to look at other alternative, because there are completely different results in google phone then iPhone.",0,
"It’s a good app, HOWEVER, google needs to improve: 1. The WiFi to LTE transfers are a mess. The app freezes whenever it picks up a WiFi signal. VERY DISRUPTIVE 2.  App freezes occasionally when on route for no reason. 3.  The North direction seems to override the up direction from time to time which is frustrating. 4.  When using “Avoid Tolls” setting, the app will show a better route and then automatically switch to the new route using tolls even if it’s set to a avoid tolls.",0,
Every time I pull up the app I have to update it before I can use it. Literally everytime! When I use the app I’m usually using it in a hurry...like a “oh crap I missed my road/exit” or something. If I’m having to update it everytime I need it then there is nothing quick about that. Don’t get me wrong. I love the app. But how about updating everything at once instead of 10 small updates,0,
"The new iPhone series X,XR and XS do not offer the facility of inverting google maps 180 degrees. This is particularly convenient for people such as me who drive with their phone charged upside down. When contacted apple they say it’s an application issue as the app would need to accept the codes in the new devices. So I’m writing to the app team asking them if they can help please !",0,
"I’ve noticed a lot of changes in last couple weeks, Google maps is not doing right, it keeps redirecting me even when I’m following the exact way that has been provided. Yesterday, it started doing weird things as redirecting, not rotating the screen as I make a turn and it’s making me turn and turn and turn rather than go straight to the destination. I’m sure it’s not my phone that getting crazy since I tried different navigation apps and all are doing great. I don’t know what’s wrong going with Google Maps. It used to be great, but no longer!",0,
Takes you right to the front door of any listed property in the USA does need a slight date I went to get my computer fixed it was a hair salon first time in 10 years that ever happened may have just closed but I enjoy my google maps want short cut just click on the bicycle lol really great app thanks google maps,0,
"I just got back from visiting my son and his family in the Phoenix area and instead of renting a car I drove him and my husband to the golf course and was super nervous about driving from the golf course , in traffic back to pick up my granddaughters for a day of shopping and fun... this app made it so easy and I never felt lost!

"My family and I move just about every year so my memory fails me A LOT! This app and its added offline download feature is great 👍🏾. Only one suggestion, I’d love to see an update on the walking section. Something like a sidewalk verification feature in the Route Options would make walking with a stroller and toddlers a safer more pleasurable experience.",0,
"Google maps is great for literally everything EXCEPT road closings. I use it daily in all sorts of cities. Would be awesome if they added on road closing info like Waze or apple maps has. FOR DEVELOPERS: supports iPhone X now, but the swipe up menu is too close to the ""go home"" swipe box, making for a lot of annoying swiping mistakes. Shifting all of that up a half inch would do wonders in the usability for the UI.",0,

I have been sent in the wrong direction so many times!  I used it to get off on Kirkman in Orlando and it says the exit is on the left!  Not anymore!  They’re doing construction on I-4 and shifted the exit to the right!  This app needs to keep up with changes!  Last night I was trying to go to a hotel and it sent me directly to Magic Kingdom’s entrance!  Also when I used to use the step by step view it used to update with every turn!  Now it doesn’t!  I keep having to go back out!  This is driving me more and more away and using another accurate app!,0,
"So much is wrong with the newest version. I loved google maps—it was my favorite of all my many navigation apps. However, since I’ve updated every time I open the app it quits. I’ll be trying to get directions to somewhere and start the navigation, then while I’m driving I’ll have realized by locking my screen the app has quit. Additionally, if I ever open any other app than google maps, google maps quits. If I tap the icon of the place I’m going—to find the address or see photos—the app quits. Ridiculous.",1,3/22/18 Are you still experiencing this issue? 1/25/18 Are you still experiencing this issue on version 4.44 of Google Maps?
The voice commands start in mid sentence which is both annoying and useless!  This is especially true when navigating totally by voice commands when visual is not an option to do the placement of the phone.  I had used this app previously in a different vehicle and didn’t have this issue.  Not sure why have it now but until this issue is corrected I will no longer be using it. (Previous vehicle was Kia Optima now using in Buick Encore) if this helps at all.,0,
I an writing this review to note a problem I found while using google maps as a navigation tool on interstate highways. There are times in which an exit route is very wide (two or three right lanes) and if one wants to stay on the original route they should use the remaining two or three left lanes. Google maps does not specify this fact and you end up in the exit lane unknowingly. Please if you can fix this proble that would help a ton. Thanks!,0,
I may be missing something but— It appears with latest update for iOS 12 and Car Play that when connected to my cars “infotainment center” that I can not control the volume. And my Civic has 540 watts. Navigation was deafening. Looks like I can mute but what good is that? Until I or Google figure the volume out I can not use this. Thanks for the fight and effort to get Car Play allowed. Now to fix the bugs,0,
"I’m a regular public transit user,  and love the ability to get accurate readings on when buses and trains will arrive, but I have been having trouble lately with Maps telling me that public transit to my destination is not possible, which I know is untrue as it’s a route I take daily. It’s a bummer not to be able to use maps anymore for public transit because when it works it’s much more accurate than anything else!",0,
First off I love google maps! It’s my go to map choice. I am a truck driver and use it everyday but recently the total trip miles when you have multiple stops does not show anymore at the bottom like it used too. This was a great feature and helped me plan my route and was good to know my total trip miles. Considering using another map format if this feature doesn’t get brought back as this is very important to me. I have an iPhone 11,0,

It’s a wonderful GPS app with lots of features especially their reviews section. I find it extraordinarily helpful and I love the satellite view &amp; grid view. Obviously it’s not gonna be as good as a topographical map but it’s pretty darn good for an app! It always gives accurate and helpful instructions with lots of filters in case you want to avoid highways or tolls.,0,
"Large parts of the map wont load at all. The app is running very slow. I can’t zoom in on areas, I can’t even see street names. Also the street view is STILL bad! It regularly blacks out the screen and even spins me around the street if I try to zoom in or navigate a specific area. The sliding of the blue lines is just poor UI. I rely on street view for my job and I wish it worked better and had a better interface. Also the app never remembers and displays any of my previous searched addresses. I have to constantly re-enter every address to search. Thank you for finally fixing the saved place labels. It took a ridiculous amount of time to acknowledge and fix but I’m very thankful it’s finally working. I miss the time when this was a basic mapping app. No features and bloatware. It worked perfectly every time!",0,
"This app is good when it comes to giving the best directions depending on the traffic, but what I’ve noticed is when I’m turning on a street or taking an exit, the screen doesn’t stay up to date with when I turn.. so eventually I have to adjust the screen so its up to date with the direction I’m in. It’s supper frustrating and I have adjust while I drive, which has led me to missing turns and exits. It needs to be updated bc at this point I’m using apple maps until it’s fixed.",0,

I’ve been with apple for seven years now and always used apple maps but it isn’t as reliable or consistent as Google Maps. Google just has toooo much data and are accurate each time. 10/10 would recommend. I literally don’t even use apple maps be google maps is amazing,0,
"This app used to work fine but about a month a go thing went wrong. And whats worse, is that this issue is not new, and till now there is no update fix. When i try to open a location the app lunches and shows me where am i only, but my destination is not there. This issue started with some people few years ago and some just gave up and sold their phones. Whats even worse is that iphone dose not allow the user to open a location using other applications like waze for no obvious reason, which is frustrating.",0,
"I love google maps, but it seems to get worse with every update. One of the most frustrating is that since a recent update, selecting an alternate route is near impossible. I have to click 5 times to find the perfect spot on the route that it wants. This wouldn’t be too bad if it gave good directions to start with, but for example, I started navigation the other day and it automatically selected the route that was 32 minutes when there was another for 25, that’s 20% less time, which is a big difference. And it was soo difficult to change it.",0,

"Recently when I use Google map for driving, it always recalculate a new route when the car stops at the crossroads. Usually this is just to wait for the lights to turn green, so there’s no need to recalculate the route again. Even it will sometimes gives a new route and it keeps happening like this, making the directions confusing. Maybe we don’t need to update “so” frequently when driving. Thanks.",0,

So I plug in my headphones, and try again, and the icon opens to see the alert options but closes immediately so I can't choose one. Also, it kept telling me to take turns while I was on the highway with no exits in sight. I had to pull over and change map apps. Added 15 minutes too my trip because of how lost I was.",0,
"This is a great app, and very accurate. The only thing that would help make this app better is to have routes for truck drivers. I drive for UPS and I like to use this for my navigation but sometimes its me places I’m not allowed to go. So can the google team help a brother out and make it an option to choose a semi-truck route?",0,
"This app is going wayyyyy down hill! Constantly freezes mid directions or when trying to open, as well as can’t keep a location pinned down so spins around thinking you’re going a different direction, only to give you new directions based on which way it thinks you’re traveling. It’s bizarre. Use GPS for my job and have had to switch to Waze due to serious inaccuracy, sending me way out of my way or just plain freezing. Send feedback to support, but nothing really changes.",0,
"So last update has apparently removed saved places in my map created for work sites. Thats just great. It was bad enough i had to keep opening the same map from the menu that i ALWAYS use everytime i wanted to use it. Now “bungle” has destroyed the map almost entirely, FFS. GREAT JOB “bungle” (aka google) of turning me from huge fan and supporter to just the opposite.",1,"We appreciate you letting us know about this issue, and we thank you for your patience as we worked on the problem.

"Along with Google’s convenient notifications on traffic conditions and time to leave, you get Google Assistant functionality as well as a great review system for restaurants and retail stores alike. I much prefer it over the stock Apple Maps app specifically for its reviews being built in and not a separate app. (Apple should just buy Yelp)",0,
"I’m not real on spot when I’m going from place to place, but when I decided to try Google Maps I was so impressed with the Point A to Point B step by step instructions! No more keeping up with a Garmin, with my own personal GPS built right into my iPhone. It’s defiantly one App I don’t leave home without! Two thumbs Up Again Google! Highly Recommended",0,
I really love the app as many do but my issue is I travel a lot and when you guys have it set up to show HOV lane closures in cities like Dallas it makes it looked like the whole interstate is closed. I end up sitting on the shoulder of the freeway trying to map out an alternate route cuz I have strict appointments to keep. Only to find out the freeway was open and just the HOV lanes were closed. Come on man! Who really cares about HOV lanes being closed as long as the rest of the freeway is open. Please come up with a fix for this.,0,
"I really like this map. I travel Monday through Friday for work, and it always is on. I enjoy being able to find good restraints, and hotels. The only gripe I have is when it tells me there is a faster way I have to hit no thank you. This causes me to look off the road and find the button. I would like it not to automatically change my route if I don’t have time to hit a button.",0,
"Google maps is a very great map app and I really like to just look around the world because I am a little young to be driving so I can’t really go places and track where I go so I just play on it. One thing I think that could be better is updating the pictures more often even though yes, it might be a little spendy and I realize that but I don’t know. It’s just an opinion; otherwise, the app is very great 👍",0,

"Usually this is the most reliable app on my phone, but no longer. Lately whenever I get directions to a place, it will start off as normal and immediately freeze up and will just stay that way. Even if the arrow does start moving again, it will mark my location point completely off from where I actually am.  I have to look at the step by step directions before I go anywhere now because this app has become unreliable for navigation. Very disappointed.",1,"If you're still experiencing this on version 4.44 of Google Maps, you can try downloading a GPS testing app (available on the App Store) to test if your GPS is working. If the app shows GPS problems, the issue is not within Google Maps."
"It would be a really awesome idea to incorporate an interactive map in which the user can use their finger to outline a certain route he or she desires and tb google app calculate the time it would take to reach the destination. Also, I’m not sure If there is but i can’t seem to find the satellite option. That would also be another great idea to add in the future update.",0,
"Google maps by far works the best, quickest, most efficiently with the Lyft driver app.  But it gets into these ruts where it keeps locating me 10 blocks down the street. Or it will randomly change to walking mode.  Or it will send me down an alley behind homes, when the address for the residence is on the facing street. When I’m trying to get a passenger to her destination, it’s very frustrating for all parties in the car to...•pull over...•force close the app...•reopen...•crap it’s still stuck...•delete and have to use Waze...•wait for Waze to open and orient itself NOT GOOD for tips or my star rating.",0,
Restart phone does not help either. The app is not responsive at all.  This is the only app that does this after updating. Should have sticked to the older version. 12/23 google replied stating I should reinstall the app. It didn't help either. App still will not start. 2/3/18 Google map is working again out of the blue.

"I gotta say this app help me from Washington to California after my phone got disconnected after a missed payment but I still managed to get to my destination through a quick search through WiFi, I stayed through route and I had to stop by and pump gas it loss connections but worked fine after I got back on route.",0,
I think that Google maps are really great. It offers you everything others do and more.  When you are planning a trip using it you can almost see with the satellite imaging what is around you . I really enjoyed using it. As a matter of fact I use it to take a trip without even leaving the my home.,0,
"I have been using Google Maps almost daily since June 2005 when I bought my T-Mobile MDA smartphone.  Today I uninstalled Google Maps forever because it no longer works right. All day long I have been trying to get transit directions using Google Maps and instead of just telling me “Bus X will arrive at the corner of A Avenue at Y time,” Google Maps is directing me to walk 3 miles, hop on a bus, hop off and walk 3 more miles.  The total distance I was going was less than 2 miles in total.  I ended up using Uber after I couldn’t get any reliable transit information using Google Maps. A call to the transit agency confirmed that there are no traffic delays or problems that would cause any rerouting or transit detours.  So I uninstalled Google Maps and used Apple’s built-in map app for the very first time and it gave me the correct transit information that I needed.",0,
"Overall google maps is great and I like the recently added feature that lets you provide feedback to the community about disabled vehicles and speed traps.  I would like to see an option to add voice alerts to these marked location. This would be great, especially with speed traps.",0,
I am having trouble with my google maps app. I love it! It’s beyond the best navigation app I have ever used. However lately my maps have not been showing ! I use the app for work so when half of my map is not showing in my screen it makes it difficult . I did not have this problem before the last update .,0,
"My go to app for all things Map, but in the past few months somethings changed in the map scrolling/searching behavior. Example: if I’m searching for golf courses, scrolling around looking at locations, it’ll snap to a random town and wipe out the search field and results. Entirely possible it’s a device fault as it’s an older iPhone 7, but I haven’t noticed touchscreen errors in any other apps.",0,
I never write reviews but i’m upset that Google Maps has been directing me to unreasonable routes that end up taking 20 minutes more than if i just took the normal route. It used to be a good navigating app but recently it would be acting up especially with locating where you are or even with the estimates of the alternate routes. Terrible. Some of these routes make you go in circles or make you sit in traffic for longer than the original route. Makes 0 sense. Writing this review as this app has made me 25 more minutes late to work while i sit in traffic.,1,"Thank you for your review.

"I have been using Google maps for a long time and was a big fan. But I am not sure if something happened with the recent updates or what.

"I use google maps for everything, I love it but the past few weeks, the app has been defaulting to showing auxiliary traffic on the map in red and green. I have to go into settings each trip and turn this off because I can’t see the colors properly contrasted with my route. I wish there were a way to permanently turn this off without it returning. It makes the directions feature very challenging for me to use.",1,"5/2/18 Did this resolve your concerns? 4/12/18 Thanks for letting us know about this issue, and your patience as we fixed the problem. We appreciate it! With the latest update, Google Maps should now be working as usual."
"It will plot ‘best’ and mid trip say something like 12 minutes to go on that route, but be showing another route and say that is now 18 minutes *faster* at that moment time...meaning I would have arrived 6 minutes ago! Also will plot a route that I KNOW is no way faster but is says is best. The one time I took the bait and went that way and sure enough 1/2 way through that it recalculated time and sure enough much slower like I anticipated. Still good map coverage so I just ignore what it says to do.",0,
My husband and I each have this app on our iPhone and during a recent trip we noticed that the audio would quit if we had to make a stop. We had to restart our phones to get it to come back on.  My other issue is that there is no pause option for stops during a trip. If we have to stop for food or gas we have to end the route and reroute again once we were ready to continue our trip.,0,
Excellent and useful. I wish there were distinct symbols for my saved places so I could recognize them without going into saved places and selecting my list restaurants for example. There are other maps that do it but I far love google maps the most and have already created all my lists here.,0,
"I’m not able to set home address nor work address anymore. Other than that, it’s amazing! I was able to prove that it shows the fastest route to your destination, even when there are major back ups. Once I’m able to set a home and work addresses and able to label all other address (like friends house or other location) it would be a five star program!",0,
"Some things still need some work, hopefully some fixes are in store with a future update. There’s no night mode. Multi-trips are not optimized: It works fine on the phone app. But, once you’ve gone past your first stop and try to go to your next, it doesn’t ask you to continue. It will try to get you back to that first stop. No way to add a stop, unless you do it on your phone. Voice guidance is really low quality.",0,
I love Google maps. I use it on my iPhone. I use it  in the car even though I have CarPlay. Why? Because Apple maps works on CarPlay but google doesn’t. So I was super excited for this version that works on CarPlay. Except it doesn’t. I’ve tried. Restarted phone. Been in and out of the car many times. And my car is only a year old. CarPlay does not work. But I still love Google maps. And I’ll still use it.,0,
Every update that comes out for this app degrades the app even further. It can no long find the fastest route. Selecting the “fastest” normally means that a minute after your last chance to take the other route you’ll be stuck in bumper to bumper traffic. The latest update now makes your phone worthless if you plug it into your vehicle. I want my map on my phone and my radio on my radio. I don’t want to have the turn by turn directions which I can’t read while I am driving displayed on my phone which is hanging on my window.,0,
The app changes drastically every two weeks or so. I think the last version where the bottom would show me traffic routes to get home and to work was the best. But now you've added explore (as the default that can't be changed) and the commute which doesn't seem to work (also very confusing/not intuitive). It's nice to see you guys always working on the app but sometimes you take away the parts of the app that people really like to use.,1,"Thank you for letting us know about this issue, and your patience as we fixed the problem. We appreciate it! With the latest update, Google Maps should now be working as usual."
"Take a little time and set up google maps for maximum convenience. I like that I can get commute updates now....although the commutes in Vancouver BC, Canada are among the top five worst on this planet and that us no joke! Google maps is more adaptable than ever before and accessible from inside other activities like Siri, Photos and videos and search!",0,
"Update to review: Really Google? One of the leading technology companies in the world and you haven’t updated your apps to work for iPhone X? After you had months to do it? Nope. Deleted and going back to Apple Maps. I love using Google Maps, more than Apple Maps, but you removed the Apple Watch app for seemingly no reason and with no warning at all. I used the Apple Watch version of Google Maps on a daily if not hourly basis. I'm am very unhappy. I'll be switching over to Apple Maps until you bring back the Apple Watch app.",0,
Need to move favorites (home and Work) to the top of the recent searches for people who use this for commuting each day. I  used this app religiously up to the last update or so for travel back and forth from work. But now it mainly only shows a LARGE list of recent finds and most of the time does not show Home and Work favorites. You have to unload and reload to get it to update route options and once you select work or Home it does not show up again. Moving to another app or device,1,"Thank you for letting us know about this issue, and your patience as we fixed the problem. We appreciate it! With the latest update, Google Maps should now be working as usual."
"By far better than Apple Maps. It was crashing for a little while there but Google developers listened fix the issue and even got back to me let me know it’s fixed. I wish Apple would let users to define the default maps app. It’s rather annoying when you click on an address or get directions to a contact and end up with Apple Maps. I was in Georgia recently and Apple Maps kept taking me about 20 miles from the address I was trying to get to. When I use Apple Maps to go to my kids elementary school , Apple bring me down some bizarre side street.  And today Apple Maps caused me to go 20 miles out of my way because it had me in the wrong lane.",1,"Thank you for letting us know about this issue, and your patience as we fixed the problem. We appreciate it! With the latest update, Google Maps should now be working as usual."
"I love this app because you can see so many beautiful pictures of monuments. I also enjoy it because all I have to do is look up some random place and it can give me a 360 degree view of any place I want to see. Another great reason is because you are able to see the world in so many great perspectives. Thanks Google, keep up the good work.",0,
"I’m not sure what’s up with the new recent updates. I honestly am upset! This is too much of a new interfaces to learn! I was so comfortable using the simple command and touch and go. Right now, I’ve lost few times in the road while trying to figure out the new update on google maps on the way to school! Ugh, please fix this GPS coordination! Everything is upside down, literally.",0,
"I just found that you can now add in multiple stops to your route plan. Fantastic! However, it does not tell you the total distance of the route. I’m trying to plan walking routes that are specific distances so it wold be nice to know the full distance of the route - not just the distance from one turn to the next.",0,
"I have always preferred google maps to other navigation apps and have rarely had issues. I did the update yesterday and now when I’m driving, the app does not automatically refresh the ETA like it used to. My location dot continues to move through the route, but the driven portion no longer turns gray with an updated time. It’s frustrating that I have to continuously delete my destination and re-enter it to get an updated ETA while I’m driving. Please fix that feature!",0,
"I always use google maps and now I’m angry at this new FOR YOU pop up. It is NOT for me especially when there is no way to get out of it and get to where I can enter my destination for directions!!!!!! This is disgraceful!!!! Even if I were on the other side of the country where these FOR ME suggestions are popping up, I WOULDNT be interested!!!!!'!!!  Time to find another navigation map system!",0,
I don’t like the fact you took the saved houses off the map. I run routs from bullhead to needles and I saved all my stops with stars and now there gone and it really helped me.

"The google team responsible for updates with maps mobile apps never seems to test their own updates. Every time they release a new update, primary features bug out- such as street view not working, or satellite view not functioning, street and satellite view images not loading despite extreme internet speeds, or satellite view reverting to older sat imagery than you just had access to before, etc. updates are suppose to improve apps, apparently googles philosophy is the exact opposite. And it reaffirms why i will never buy google hardware.",0,
"New update on IOS and Google Maps and now the map feature doesn’t work. You only get the step by step WRITTEN driving instructions. If you use the map feature it’s the one before you hit start so it’s zoomed out and if you zoom in it won’t follow your movements. Super big glitch! If they fix the issues it’d be a 5 star because you can finally access the written driving instructions easily without any hassle. For now though, it’s not usable as a GPS map and that makes it unusable for pretty much everything.",0,
"Love this app, and google in general for keeping all my life organized and together. My husband and I though, like to carpool some days to work and when we want to get there the quickest, living in OC California we would obviously take the carpool lane. Unfortunately, this app doesn’t give the option to tell it that we are able to use the carpool which is the quickest, but will instead make us go side streets. Please update",0,
"I love driving around now with the Google Maps satellite view scrolling while I drive, learning so much about my own neck of the woods! Only minor issue is that I still don't see the Apple Music integration in settings, days after updating the app to the new Connie features.. Other than this minor glitch, this is a first class Navigation app.",0,
"Google Maps is by far the best app for maps and GPS. There is even an option to switch the map displayed from a general map, to a terrain map, to satellite map, to a transportation map. Some of the best map app opportunities are found with Google Maps. There are also notifications that show the traffic one might face on a particular route.",0,
"At this day and age I rely on google maps for everything. Directions. Reviews. Traffic. Yeah apps like waze and yelp are cool but this is the catch all app. I’m terrible with directions and use google maps for drives across the country to drives to my Wal-Mart down the street. Google changed the game and are constantly improving it so competitors like apple maps(got me lost several times) will never be able to compete. Also, I throughly enjoy writing reviews for google. God help people like myself when the world ends and our phone service goes out. Better brush up map reading skills every now and again. You guys remember paper maps? Ha!",0,
"Let me start by saying I’m a professional truck driver. This app is good on its own merit, but( Here it comes) it could be better. For example, sometimes my Rand McNally GPS likes to be stubborn and not find a location. Google Maps would have it, but won’t be so truck friendly on the routes. If there was a way to program truck routing into Google Maps, that would be amazing. So, until that option is available, I’m gonna give it 3 stars.",0,
"Great app and always loved using the app; however, whenever I open the app it freezes and takes several minutes to stop freezing. I force close the app and open again and it's still frozen.

Very very impressive, very important to have it in your phone. Never leave home without google maps. ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️",0,
"Every time I actually close google maps now (swipe it away), the traffic layer turns off.

"This has been my go-to maps app for years. Idk what’s happened to it. If I’m 1/4 Mile from a house I’m looking for, it will send me in a 10 mile loop to pull into the driveway from the other side. There is no good reason for this. No medians, no one way streets. I guess Google just likes sending me in circles now. Not a one time thing. Maybe 10 times yesterday. Two other times, I’ve been sent to a completely different road than the house is on, and told that I’m there. It turns out that the house is 1/2 mile through the woods in that general area, but on a different road. I don’t get it.",0,
It’s my go to navigation. Since Google already knows everything about us it makes finding addresses much quicker in the search bar because it pretty much knows where you’re going before you go in there. It is far better than the Apple navigation app in every way. Keep up the good work!,0,
"While still not perfect and with the occasional bug, it is by far the most reliable day in day out navigation app out there. I really wish it had Waze’s useful and interactive features but at the end of the day, google maps is the more consistent one so it’s definitely worth it.",0,
"With my driving job, it is useful to help me to get to many destinations.  Most of the time the directions are accurate and I am supporting this Google Maps by communicating with them with correction of house numbers/business closed/wrong location. They do follow up quickly with my suggestions.  This is nice to have an extra map as a back up in case other maps are inaccurate.",0,
"I used to exclusively use Google maps for driving directions but now I never do. The app constantly lags or the arrow faces the wrong direction or it takes forever to reroute me because it lagged and I missed a turn.  Not sure what’s going on, started about a few months ago. I did all the usual things of closing the app in the background, soft reset on my phone, deleted the app and re-added it. Nothing solves the lagging issue. I have since switched to Waze which doesn’t have these issues. Thanks anyway Google.",0,
"I use Google Maps more than any other app, maybe to excess. I love maps, I love memorizing geographies, and daydreaming about places I'd like to go. It makes me so sad that there's no ""neutral"" state any more. You have to be driving, in transit, or consuming (""exploring""). I just want to look at the map, without the clutter of station info and that horrible traffic data. I live in NYC. Nobody wants to see those stressful red lines, which are always red, every time they open the app. Poor user experience, it's like Data from Star Trek designed the update. It ""makes sense"" but it isn't delightful to use.",1,"Thank you for letting us know about this issue, and your patience as we fixed the problem. We appreciate it!

"I've used this for work for the past 6-months, but now I'm switching back to Apple's. The app refuses to look up actual addresses now, instead it locates associated buildings. This has been a problem for the past two-weeks and is extremely inconvenient for someone who has to look up 20 addresses a day. For instance, when I type in an address like 110 W 12th Ave., the address that the app will show is the leasing office across town at 382 E 4th Ave. Just show me the address I want to see! Why on earth would I want to see the leasing office!? If I wanted to see it, I'd look it up myself!",1,4/3/18 Are you still experiencing this issue? 3/22/18 Sorry to hear about this issue!

"Used for first when the audio function on my Garmin GPS died. Everything worked fine until I was within a quarter mile of destination. No indication of arrival and if It was on the left or right. I have been to the destination before; so I knew to turn into the strip mall. Only when I entered the parking lot did the app indicate arrival and on what side. Otherwise, I would have passed by completely. I will wait to see if this issue is addressed before gettin another Garmin.",0,
"Each ""update"" of this app has gotten worse. I was on an hour long trip and it stopped the navigation twice each way. That's a pretty dangerous issues, especially if one is driving alone. Update on September 16: This app is still pretty bad. It's great to add new features, but my primary issue is with the navigation system, which continues to stop after a certain period of driving. Perhaps I'm the only one with this issue since google continue to rank very well. However, I would hope that this is somehow addressed and acknowledged.",0,

"It works great and does a good job rerouting when there’s traffic. However, it’s hard to moved a route around if you want to go a specific way. The biggest issue is the voice doesn’t always talk.

"I’ve never had an issue with this app, but I went to Boston yesterday and the thing was going crazy. It kept changing the route and didn’t seem to understand overpasses and underpasses.

"I can’t get Google Maps to access contacts in suggested locations on my iPhone 8 with iOS 11. On my old phone, I was able to turn on “access contacts” on the Google Maps settings screen. Also, make “my places” easier to access. They used to be listed on the first drop down menu. Now I have to click into another menu to get to them.",0,
I was referred to Solutions from a pest professional for a certain product to control rodents. Tayron was very knowledgeable and explained the product in detail and even illustrated how to place the packets.

"Not sure what the issue is but suddenly it is not showing me my favorites that I saved Home and work, just shows history but irrelevant history. Today it wouldn’t even figure out that I wanted to travel from my current location I had to put that in too.

"I used to love this app and used it all the time. But all of a sudden, within the last week or two, it keeps getting my current location wrong. I take the subway and My Location always has me at a completely different subway stop than where I actually am. Opening and closing the app does nothing. Even turning off my phone doesn't work. I can figure out how to get where I need to go but why the hell should I have to? Fix it ASAP before I have to go to Apple maps instead!",0,
"Ever since the recent update it’s terrible. Bring it back to where it was. It does not give you specific directions you’re already passed a street and It will tell you to make a right-hand turn or a left-hand turn on that street once you’ve already passed it. I don’t understand what you guys did it was working perfectly before,  Constantly rerouting it’s route. Why do you always have to destroy something when it works perfectly? Please fix it.  Or I’ll find something else to use.",0,
Awesome maps. It knows roads that no other map application has and the most updated maps. Would be awesome to have speed limits since it's becoming the standard for most gps applications. Weather would also be Plus but otherwise this is the only gps application I use and trust 100 percent. Never has is failed me yet. Thanks Google!!,0,
"Stellar app - I use this and don’t even consider Apple Maps. However, as I often listen to audiobooks and songs, I’m tired of the voice freaking out and interrupting the audiobook experience whenever I pull off to get gas or drive through a restaurant. Please add to the app so that the navigation system guesses that you’re taking a break and stays quiet. Thanks!",0,
"Since previous update, When I search for a place and tap directions, it shows directions but after a second automatically returns to search result. In Iran (which I have tested it) , turn by turn navigation is not active yet, so maybe this bug doesn't exist in other areas of the world.",0,
The new update gives inaccurate directions until the last moment when on the expressway. With in the last few weeks I’ve had to get off the expressway 4 to sometimes 8 or more miles passed the exit I was suppose to get off just to turn around. I used to use my google maps gps rather than my cars gps. Also when I search for a certain place near me it give me location more than 40 miles away as if my google maps doesnt know when the hell I'm at. Please fix or I’m not going to be using google maps anymore.,0,
As a first time car buyer I was a little nervous  so knew what I wanted or at least the style. Jennifer let me test drive all three picks and was so casual and didn’t stress me out while driving.

The new google map is like a cartoon map. I’m not sure who their target demographic is but it’s not anyone who just wants a map! Driving around in a city it was hard to clearly find STREET NAMES! (very bad on a map!) and there was no way to get rid of all the businesses (which I assume pay) that pop up in large icons all over the map.  These upgrades have made my google map app useless— after years of using google maps I’m going to delete it! There is no way to change the settings — NO SETTINGS (very useless settings). Really sad engineering of app update.,0,
Are these updates actually downgrades? I don’t get it.  The app becomes less and less reliable with every update.  The directions aren’t updating as I’m driving and I drive for Uber so it’s extremely important to know where I am going.  The audio is turned on but there are no audio directions being given.  And I keep turning on the “avoid tolls” option but then a few days later I find myself on a toll and I find the “avoid tolls” option has turned itself off.  So frustrating and annoying.  Please go back to 5-10 updates ago!!,0,
"I’ve been using google maps for ages but as of late it’s been awfully glitchy. It’ll start off just fine but then half way through the drive the voice navigation gives completely out and then the visual turn by turn directions stops working as well.

"I’m not sure what the problem is, other than updates being needed by developers, but this app used to be solid.  But here lately, it’s NOT. I use the live traffic data, and then take my own route based on experience.  This app used to pick the best routes consistently, but it just isn’t what it used to be. It has trouble loading sometimes.  It won’t give me vocal commands sometimes. It won’t give me 2 or 3 options like it used to.  It’s just not what it used to be.  Dang shame, because it WAS great.",0,
"Something happened with Google and it’s working with Maps. I used to say to Google, Billy Joe’s restaurant and it would pop up and I would hit directions and it would go right to google maps and take me there. It does not work like that anymore, I hit the restaurant and it takes me to five or six screens and does not end up at Google maps with the directions to where I’m going",0,
Maybe u can add live shop bettwen the person and the shop if he need to ask about something before go there so will save time and money and decrease the traffic in street and also maybe u can add icon for traffic and RTA so people can help other people to take other way if there is RTA and that will help,0,
Map shows I made turn before I make the turn so when I look back at the map I think I need to continue straight ahead and when I do I obviously missed the turn.  This occurs on my iPhone and the other 3 iPhones we own they all do the same thing so I know it’s not just my iPhone.  This has been happening for approximately 3 months now.

"Idk what’s happening all of a sudden, but for the past two weeks whenever I use the app it’s not moving with me. For instance, I turn right and the map doesn’t move to show me going straight, it shows me going right. I have to either manually move the map to show me going straight ahead or try to figure out when I come to a turn if it’s wanting me to go right or left.

"So I have been facing this issue over the last 3 days. Everytime I’m on the highway, it fails to tell me where my next exit is. It doesn’t say, neither does it show on the map on the top that I’m just 2 miles away or .5 mile away from my exit. Twice I almost met into an accident due to this as it didn’t tell me that my exit is approaching and I didn’t get time enough to change the lanes smoothly. This is a recent issue. Please revert back to old and saver version. This version is prone to causing accidents. And that’s a serious problem.",0,
I use the google maps app often during the day for short delivery runs. To enter an address isn’t as quickly done as it once was. Currently when opening the app a bottom pull up bar/tab name “explore nearby” always slides up and in that process covers the half of the view of the map and also if I have slow Data speeds or slow WiFi the app is slower to start or open because the explore nearby bar is trying to shoot upwards.,1,Thanks for your review!

"So Google maps is amazing. But I really wanted to post about just how bad apple maps is, EVEN IN 2018. Years after its launch Apple directed me THE WRONG WAY UP A ONE WAY STREET IN NEW HAVEN CONNECTICUT - in their downtown area. Absolutely horrendous.

"Waze needs to be updated! It used to be much better and accurate before you as Google bought it!! Now it is not as Accurate, it doesn’t response fast enough!! Instead of a short u turn, the direction takes My a block or two to just make a u turns!! Sometimes it is big time off the target!! But when it works fine, it is working fine and accurate!! I would go for another google maps or navigations but some times they don’t talk at all so I have to keep looking at the direction on the screen of my phone, which is not practice or safe!! I hope you update Waze in a more periodically way because a lot of times it is very far from the right destination!! I am starting to be big time very disappointed!! Thank you, Moustafa Rady",0,
Google maps is a great way to make a trip plan and follow that plan to your destination. It would be a lot more convenient if there was an option to choose routing for Commercial Motor Vehicles. That would making travel for truckers a lot simpler and more time efficient. I hope this idea is possible. Thanks google Maps!,0,
"It would sure be nice if when I go to search by voice, the app did not erroneously report that I need to enable the microphone in settings under privacy. How about giving me the option to see the fastest route via toll and freeway. Currently I have to switch to ""avoid tolls"" to see that I can save $5 if I'm willing to drive two more minutes. Also, when I'm sitting in traffic on the highway, the app should alert me if there is a side street route available that is faster.",0,
I’m having the same issues as another reviewer. Upgraded iPhone from 6 to 8. With iPhone 8 google maps kept freezing throughout my route and would not give me updates until I should already be for ex. on an off ramp. It would get confused when I would get to a spot where maps was telling me I can take a different route and would not update fast enough to see I was still on the same route. Super frustrating and now I have to find a different map app to use because google maps has become too unreliable.,0,
I’ve been a faithful Google Maps user for years and I highly depend on the app especially now since I’m stationed in Bahrain. Yesterday the map arrow was pointing in a different direction and then it told me to make a sharp left when I was on the freeway. Had I not been with someone familiar with the area I would have been lost or had to find another navigation app. It also gives the wrong estimate on how long it takes to get somewhere. Something 5 minutes away ended up showing as 1 hour and 15 minutes to get there. Please fix!!,0,
I’m an Uber and Lyft driver so I need a map that works all the time accurately and quickly. This app used to work well but recently it freezes - 8 out of 10 times. It registers the location but once it gets to the “start” button to begin the trip it freezes. I can tap it multiple times and...nothing. Closing out of the app and reopening it doesn’t work. It only happens with this app and only happens when it’s time to start the trip. Freezing 8 out of 10 trips isn’t a good ratio. Switching to another app that I really don’t like using but it’s the only alternative,1,"3/22/18 Did this resolve your concerns? 1/24/18 Thank you for letting us know about this issue, and your patience as we fixed the problem.

As a driver in ny the ability to move stops around and customize the maps is more than useful but the app needs to offer a truck setting to avoid parkways because it is illegal for commercial vehicles to be on parkways in ny and sometimes i accidently end up on one because of the gps and the tickets can sometimes be up to $600 and i have to pay them,0,
"I have an iPhone 8+, for about a week now, every time I use this app it crashes on me. It will just freeze then it freezes my phone.

"I loved using google maps, but recently it’s been acting up on me when I’m driving. Most instances it will just freeze and not update in real time or it’ll be confused as to where I am on the highway and tell me to take turns on streets.

So disappointing because I’m not a fan of Maps on my phone, but i might have to download it again if google maps isn’t working properly.",0,
"The map is fine. Can’t comment on directions as I don’t use them. But the user interface just keeps getting worse. I long for the google maps of old that doesn’t clutter your screen with an unwanted recommendation tab at the bottom each time you open it.

"Mostly my “go to” maps app. Always has been. Would give 4.75 stars since it’s not perfect, but it’s pretty close to it. Aside for using Google Maps (GM) in how to get somewhere, I use GM to view traffic flow, read about places I’d like to visit, and write reviews about places I’ve been to. Only one real complaint; Recent update makes it harder to navigate to contributions. Sometimes fixing things break things that don’t need to be fixed, and navigating within the app itself should be just as important. And one suggestion; If in motion, would like to see posted speed limit based on your location when using app even when not driving to a specific destination.",0,
Use this even if you have an iPhone.  Thank you for having auto dimming at night. User interface is so much easier to use and voice search loads much better results.  Alternate routes is a feature I use almost every time I gps something.  Keep up the great work Google!,0,
Garbage app that consistently can’t take you to the road you’re requesting. It will however make up roads that aren’t there for you to try to find. Also likes to take one to roads parallel to the road you literally have typed into the app and the app acknowledges the road but then sticks you on the wrong road or the alley behind the road you want to be on. Turns out just looking at the map with the location you requested works ten times better than the entire purpose of the app... So actual maps are better. Google maps your overly engineered crap.,0,
Apple did some update and completely screwed up all the address in my neighborhood. The address for my house location isn’t even on my street. Awesome. It’s saying my address is down the road. Google has never screwed up this bad. At least Google is reliable.,0,
This app will literally put your life in danger. It’s truly terrifying how awful this app is. Not only does it not have the slightest clue what to do the moment you don’t follow its directions putting your life in danger. It has this cute glitch where it believes your in a residential area when you’re actually going 75 MPH on a highway and it’s telling you to turn on Magnolia Lane. Worst and most preventable. It insist that telling you to continue straight only to tell you to turn in 400 feet after giving you no time to adjust. This app is truly deadly. Download Ways app not this garbage.,0,

"I used to love google maps. Here lately, every time I use it for out-of-town trips it gives me terrible directions. Instead of telling me to stay on the interstate for 20 miles, it tells me to “keep left at the fork” or “keep right and follow signs” when in reality I am supposed to stay on the interstate and not take the exits. It is very confusing and hard to follow while driving. While driving through Florida, it told me to keep right at the fork, and as soon as I got to the fork (which was actually an exit) it told me to keep left. Just very confusing.",0,
I used to give this app 5 stars but for the last two weeks or so it has been having some major issues. Sometimes it has connection problems and search results won’t load.

I would like highway and road numbers if a number is designated for it. Road name is insignificant in my world especially in unfamiliar areas. Rte 93 or rte 489 is more informative than Main st or 5 Star Highway.

Was more user friendly to just tap ONE icon at the bottom to select desired feature. Would be nice to integrate a voice feature like ""find nearest ___ along current route."" Latest update keep starting out routes in preview have to go back up and tap on my location in the bar to get it to show the map. Not really handy for 50 to 60 locations a day",0,
"I manage a territory in the Seattle area, and commute from 40 miles outside of the city each day. This app has never let me down. Accurate and reliable. Calculates routes and ETA's in real, accurate time. Can't say enough! Blows the iPhone ""maps"" away. No matter what traffic situation I've been in, the ETA stayed true. Lots of other features also.",0,
"I’m not sure what the problem is lately, this used to be so much better than any gps app out there. But all of a sudden over the past 2 months or so, I’m being sent the wrong way down one-way roads, my ETA is 45 minutes for a 10 minute drive, and I’m being told to drive in circles. Safari has been a lot more reliable lately. Please fix the issues, Google. I like your format so much better. But I can’t use it reliably right now.",0,
"Please do not update this app if you already have it on your phone. They changed up the app so much which makes no sense because it was perfect before. This new update specializes in never knowing what direction your facing, not moving with you as you turn anymore and countless other problems. Used to never use apple maps because google was perfect now I jus deleted this worthless app after having it for 8 years. Thanks google for trying so hard to do something to update an app that had no issues to begin with great job! 👍🏻",1,"Thank you for letting us know about this issue, and your patience as we fixed the problem. We appreciate it! With the latest update, Google Maps should now be working as usual."
"Needs to be updated for the highway exits near Maryland and Washington. Had to reroute multiple times because the distance was off or the map wasn’t correctly showing where it was located. Also for one way roads, this app has almost killed me one too many times!! I’m not sure if it’s just for Richmond VA, but now I’d rather park my car far away in a garage and walk in the heat than risk going down the wrong lane and having a panic attack trying to turn back around and getting treated like an idiot.",0,
"Google maps are an Awesome Driving app, a definite must have. This is life saver app, and if used properly can save you a pocket full of money, I believe it’s important, to go to your settings to make sure your app is set to your meets “important.” I hope this helps others on the road, to save some money and find new and interesting place.:-))",0,
"I do like ALMOST all of the Google Map features. The one thing I can’t use is the “tour guide” feature. When I’m in a hurry, I want to get to my destination asap. I don’t need, or want to know all the attractions I’m passing along the way. I just want to get there! Now, if you had two modes, one for quickest route and another that shows features( sponsors) off the route that may be visited, I’d be up for that.",0,
"I have no clue what path this application was envisioning, but it took us to an unrealistic gravel “road”, much more the size of a trail. And expected me to be able to drive 9 miles in conditions that were insane. We were 9 hours into a road trip headed toward the mountains in NM. Once we got to a sign letting us know that the paved roads were ending, we continued driving maybe 100 feet. I turned around and started back tracking a ton just so we could get on a route that actually got us to our destination. Unbelievably disappointed, and will no longer use google maps.",0,
"I’ve been using Google Maps as my preferred map for years. I diligently update photos and videos and do reviews on the site via another gmail account. For the second time in a month, it has failed me. I wanted to route a general map of a trip I recently took and it maxed out at ten destinations. I had to switch to Bing, which accomplished what I needed to quickly and easily. Today, I wanted to map a route that I just walked. The interface has changed and it is now blocking half the screen, prompting me to choose Uber or Lyft. I. Don’t. Want. To. Use. Them. I also can’t minimize or remove the prompt. And because of that, I am unable to enter a second stop on my route. Bing Maps - even Apple Maps - is - are - looking better and better. If this isn’t resolved, I’ll be leaving Google Maps and assisting other mapping companies to plot destinations with my photos/reviews/updates.",0,
"Update:  I’ve been a long time google user and have always relied on google maps but now I’m disappointed with this latest version. The new ""feature"" which gives me no option but to see a (probably highly inaccurate) average calorie burn estimate when I want to walk somewhere is incredibly dangerous to those suffering from eating disorders/disordered eating, and underage users who are more vulnerable. Whoever thought it was a good idea clearly wasn't thinking that they could be harming a significant portion of the population and putting so many people at risk. Probably highly inaccurate at best, capable of contributing to someone's death at worst. This is not a helpful feature. PLEASE: - Consider removing it now that you've been made aware it's putting vulnerable people at risk - If you must keep it, have it as an option that the user must elect to turn on in a menu, not as default",0,
1. Travel time no longer updates on preview screen as you move forward. 2. Too many overlays on main screen. If I want to explore nearby I should be able to choose off a hidden menu. Let maps be just maps and if we want other features let us choose instead of taking up valuable screen space unnecessarily.,0,
"Thanks for Apple CarPlay and Siri integration but in the last update or so the app changed so I can’t quickly see the travel time to different locations. If I search for a store I used to be able to quickly see the travel time to each, now it takes a lot of work. I have to tap to get directions for each to see travel times.",0,

"Google doesn’t make changes that are better for users, it makes changes that are better for itself. We know this, we’re cynical about it, and Google knows we know. But it’s gotten really bad in recent versions of google maps. I don’t want to “explore” the area around me so Google can get money any time I follow one of its suggestions. I don’t want to be signed into my Google account to be tracked on every app just because I signed in on one. But most people concede defeat, and Google helps itself to more and more of our data.",0,
"I work at Waitr and am constantly having to use GPS to find where places are. I have gotten to a point I can’t use Google Maps anymore because the Lyft ad won’t let me use the app. It doesn’t make me want to use Lyft, if anything, it makes me want to call an Uber instead. I’m at a point where I am having to delete the app all together because if I can’t use it for it’s intended purpose, then I much rather just use the crappy one that comes automatically on my phone, which is a shame because I like Google Maps otherwise.",0,

Not sure if an update happened and messed up the logic but it seems Google maps lost some roads and the logic to route directions has changed for the worse. I hope it’s a glitch that they find and correct but I always use Google maps but last week I had to change to apple maps because it was working properly. Please fix whatever you broke!,0,
Google maps has helped us so much with directions and also reviews. I now take the time to show gratitude to those small business that deserves some praise for the hard work they put into their business ownership. We all know there is scammers out there but that is the world we live in where we have to share the same space. I think if we are all kindhearted citizens and have human compassion. We should always help others. Maps has also assisted us with our long travels across the country and into other countries we are not familiar with. Let’s keep it honest for ourselves and for everyone else.,0,
The new update is terrible. Map always points north even though that function is turned off in settings and defaults back to pointing north after I change it if the orientation of the map changes or if I leave the app and come back to it. I also don’t like the commute option I’d rather have my most used locations come up automatically. Directions disappear from map view. The traffic disappears from map view . I have to close out the app and restart frequently now.,0,
I miss the simplicity of the old google maps where it would give turn by turn directions with the phone being locked. Now all we get are notifications which are illegal to read while driving. I also get consistent loading problems in the Los Angeles area which is ridiculous. Full signal strength and the app will not function about 60% of the time. I may as well buy Thomas Guides again.  Those are consistent at least!,0,
How is this possibly better for the iPhone than apple maps?? you can control music safely within the maps app which makes it so seamless to control your music safely! I’m excited to see what’s in store for future updates as each one gets better and more fine tuned than the last. Keep up the work!,0,
"Love the app All of my places I've saved are on google maps, is there a way to transfer the places onto Waze or other google owned mapping apps?

Google maps has been helpful but it needs to have more direct routes.  I have been able to figure all routes out by reviewing them and revising them a little if I know what routes save time to destinations. I always use Google maps if I am uncertain of how to arrive at destination.   Love information on Google maps.,0,
"The app was great until a month or 2 ago. Now on my phone(i phone 6), it consistently shuts down after 10 minutes, which is apparently when I often need it. Sometimes it lasts a good long time, but you never know when it'll turn off. And when I'm up in the mountains and there's sparse service, or when I'm driving and can't be futzing with my phone, it can be a definite problem. I'm trying to be patient waiting for the fix. I hope the fix comes out soon!",0,
Still better than Apple maps. I don’t know how many times I gave Apple a chance only to have to switch back to Google because they were sending me the wrong way or the information was not accurate. Definitely better and more reliable.,0,
"This app is amazing. But please remove that stupid option of extra information after I hit “start” for a route. Many times I’m already on the road and need to go somewhere. I found the place, then I select the road I want to take, after I hit “start” a stupid page with information page appears, I closed then another one prompts out. I missed exists or turns because of this. Please, make that optional.",1,"Thanks for the review.

Recently my family had to make the decision to place my mother in an assisted living facility. Senior One Source was recommended to us and they did not fail us.

I always leave his office feeling that he is taking the best possible care of me.",0,
UPDATE-Just updated my phone to latest IOS and app appears to be functioning properly now. Gave it 5 stars. I agree with the other user. Never had a problem with google maps until a couple months ago. It just freezes up and is completely useless on the 6s. Please fix ASAP.,0,
"This last update knocked this down from 5 stars. From the last version: I appreciate seeing the different route options initially and then choosing one. I also appreciate being able to zoom in and out without it resetting itself. With this version, I find the traffic colors very helpful!",0,
"I like using this app since it works well when I have to go somewhere for the first time...BUT not completely. It sometimes has me thinking I facing the wrong way with the confused arrow when I’m not. Also, the arrow goes somewhere else and then stays there when I’m trying to figure out where I am. Google Maps is good but bad at the same time. Sometimes I switch back and forth from Apple Maps and Google Maps for some relief.",0,
"I used to have an iPhone 6s, and Google Maps occasionally had problems with refreshing fast enough to route me properly in busy city settings, sometimes even when I was biking. With the iPhone 10, this happens regularly, pretty much every time I’m downtown. Now, with the latest update, my phone gets incredibly hot. I will now stop using this app, I can’t risk my new iPhone X overheating. Overheating was the reason I stopped using Waze on my iPhone 6. It looks like this trait has become contagious in the family.",0,
"I am not sure who is in charge of the behind the scenes of this app, but they definitely need a raise! I lost my vehicle back in September and have been using this app ever since for public transportation navigation through the city and it is always accurate and always gets me there on time! It’s completely better than my iPhone map!",0,
"Google has faithfully guided me just about everywhere with few errors. I go places, find unique sites, and research trips often. Two things to improve: make state lines more visible. They are there, but in fine, light grey lines, barely findable. And keep font size constant when zooming in. I often zoom to read city/ street names better, only to find print shrinking as roads enlarge. Maddening!",0,
"Talk about a complete cluster of a mess as soon as it’s opened. Even on a large screened device such as an iPhone 8 Plus, it’s so difficult to find anything quickly without massive scrolling and clicking even for something as basic as gas. Bottom line this app is dangerous and useless for those of us who spend a ton of time behind the wheel. We need something quick and with as little clicking as possible. Everytime I use the app while driving I am putting my life in danger far more than using other gps apps. I’m done with goggle maps.",0,
"I work as a night dispatcher for a towing company. I receive roadside assistance requests from customers who are in need. I have to be able to accurately map mileage distance to everywhere. Google Maps does that and more. It’s the best local &amp; long distance search engine out there! I won’t use anything else, personally or professionally!",0,
"By far and hands down this beats iOS maps, that being said when I do a search for places that I have been to and saved in favorites id now trying to send me way off course. 100 miles or more off course. I have used these same locations that I saved numerous times and never had issues, and if I hand type the coordinates in maps will send me to the correct pin position. Needs to be looked into.",0,
"Google Maps was great until it now re-routes you the faster route after you pick the route you want to go.    Even when it suggests the faster route, and you say no thanks, it will prompt again, and if you do catch it, it automatically re-routes.     I tried looking in the settings for ways to change this, but found nothing.    I even looked it up online and saw others were having the same issue.    Please fix this.",1,"Thank you for letting us know about this issue, and your patience as we fixed the problem. We appreciate it! With the latest update, Google Maps should now be working as usual."
"Generally I love Google maps but I am experiencing a bug. Even when I have the option of avoiding tolls turned on, it always tells me to take the express lanes on the highway. This would cost me about $10 a trip so I am not interested! I wish I could get directions that do not include the express lanes. It affects my directions because the express lanes have certain exits and so it changes my actual route, and it gives me an inaccurate estimate of when I will get to my destination.",0,
"The directions kept trying to have me take a frontage road . Once I arrived in town I did not receive prompts with exit numbers or even street names, but rather was randomly prompted to ""turn right"" within 5 feet from the turn which was necessary to be taken. Had I not been somewhat familiar with where I should be headed I would have been led on a ""wild goose chase"". This was the worst gps guided directional route I've ever experienced with this company!",0,
"I like how this app finds the address of the establishments by simply typing in a name however, it does not inform you if there are multiple establishments of the same name within the vicinity. On multiple occasions, I have traveled to the wrong establishment because I was given directions by Google App. The app did not inform me that their were establishments of the same name in close proximity.",0,
"Would give this 5 stars but every time I go to avoid tolls or highways it takes me 5 minutes to figure out where this option is. Wish this was a very easy toggle button right above where you see the full directions listed, not hidden where you need to click on 3 random things to get there.... not intuitive at all.",0,
"Railroad tracks are an excellent point of reference for a traveler not familiar with an area as they drive - the most common reason for even using Google Maps!  Think how many times you take a quick glance at a map and say to yourself something like ""pass over the tracks, then make a right"" - or something like that. Please put the railroad tracks back on the map (like Apple does in the iOS map) on your next app update.",0,
"This is the best navigation app within the app store. I have tried Waze and Apple Maps and I have been utterly disappointed. Google maps is easy to use for ALL age groups and it has so many features they will make traveling easier like adding stops, finding the fastest routes to get to your destination, etc.",0,
"I think this app is wonderful.  It will let you know when to turn BEFORE you miss your turn. It is accurate, gives you plenty of warning for turns and adjusts directions if you missed a turn or an exit. It will keep directing you until you get to your destination.  Totally stress free guidance.",0,
"Valentino was the perfect salesperson that assisted with my new vehicle purchase.

"I’m a hardworking individual and someone didn’t like my work ethics so they put my name on google maps rate my business, they left a horrible review about me and not the business... I reported it to Google but they did nothing about it. I wish they could see this as an issue. otherwise this is a great app",0,
"I am going on a trip today and I need a navigation system that is online. So what did I do, I downloaded offline maps! Google, thank you 🙏 for developing a navigation system that is offline! I enjoy Google Maps and plan to use it a lot! Hopefully, one day Apple will make a offline navigation system!",0,

"I’ve been using the app solely to access my own saved places maps. Every time I access one and need to turn layers on or off, then back out and go back to the map, the map refreshes and goes back to the old settings. This is horrible. I’m usually deep out in the woods exploring and completely rely on this app to get me where I’m going and back again. I can’t even change the background map anymore to see what the terrain looks like. I’m dying here, please fix!!!",0,

Please stop changing your app! You have literally change the interface for three weeks in a row I know this because I go to visit a friend every Wednesday and I have to figure out how your app works every Wednesday night to get home. It drives me nuts! please stop trying to “improve” it. I swear if you change it one more time I’m going to give you a horrible review and then download a new app.,0,
"Haven’t even seen the update yet and already disappointed to see you changed the icon to something less pleasing than what it was. Here’s a hint don’t change it if it isn’t broke. I’m sure new worthless clutter, I mean features were added as usual and they probably removed functional aspects instead of giving the users a choice to disable. Keep it up google Apple Maps is starting to look like it may be a better option",0,
"I’ve followed all the helps and advisories and I still can’t get the app to download. Had it on my old iPad just fine. Use G-Maps when traveling, biking, and hiking, so I really miss it. It is almost certainly the best map app out there—easy to use, lots of info—Hope someone can figure this out and let me know.",0,
I have read some complaints as to lag time. My son uses google maps as his go to while driving and has never had a problem with it.  Sometimes it might not be the app but the phone service you are using. An app cannot do anything if if it is not receiving information.,0,
"I like using Google Maps, but even though I have location services set to “While using the app”, I recently took a picture of a restaurant I visited, then promptly got a notification from Google Maps to share more information about this location. So, without Google Maps opened, or even running in the background, how does the app know where I am and that I took a picture of a restaurant?",0,
"I would put Google Maps second. The sole reason is that I don't use it, but my dad does. I know that it is good to use. It does seem like something you would have to get used to and figure all the little things out for it. Overall i would give this a 4.5/5 as it is good but I just don't feel a need to use it as I already have a built in maps installed on my Iphone.",0,
"You’re making me look bad from my previous review, Google Maps. I highly ranked you before but now there’s issues. Your directions either stop after a turn or don’t sync with my precise position. Also, what gives with the start button, dudes? I tap it (firmly mind you) but nothing happens! Is it me? Are you moody? Am I moody? You’ve been frustrating me with this lately. Please fix it, I don’t want to give up on you.",0,
"Since I’m legally blind, I often look for bus routes and schedules so I am able to rely on this in addition to my orientation and mobility skills to reach destinations successfully. Also, I turn to the app for activities on date night, and I have found and interesting event or two, which made for some very enjoyable evenings!",0,
"Since the update 2 weeks ago, there have been issues. When driving to the next set of directions, the map doesn’t realize that I’ve already turned onto that road. It just freezes with the previous direction and it takes a while for it to update to the next step. I’m just having to manually skip at the top to the next step. Please fix!!",0,
"My app has all of a sudden stopped working- in the sense that it stops telling me directions and gets stuck on an old direction. For example, it will say “turn left on chestnut street” and then it won’t say afterwards to “turn right on 46th street”- rather the screen will just show “turn left on chestnut street”. The map will continue to move, but when you are driving it is hard to look at the screen to figure out which street you are turning onto, especially when the street names are hidden sometimes.",0,
"Hey guys, the app is fantastic, no doubt. BUT I would really like to see an addition/filter for RVers or drivers of taller vehicles. Of course it’s understood that you should use expressways not parkways with trailers or an RV, but if you could add a filter for drivers of these vehicles to set a route that considers their vehicle, that would be awesome. That’d be five stars for certain. Thanks for your consideration, and I do hope you guys read these things....",0,
"This used to be great but now it refuses to speak the navigation. I'll get a couple of directions maybe at the beginning but then I have to rely strictly on the screen in order to find out where I'm going. As someone who is VERY AGAINST dieing in a violent car accident, this concerns me. I hate looking at my phone when I'm driving but it's either that or keep driving in circles. I think Google has moved on to bigger and better things because they certainly aren't giving one of their most popular services the attention it needs.",0,
"I’ve tried to defend google for years on this but I just can’t any more. At this point the re-route features have cost me hundreds of hours of my time while driving across the country. It constantly misreads traffic flow, as well as making new construction zones a complete nightmare. How about letting people stick with the route they planned on rather than CONSTANTLY trying to redirect. I’ve let this app ruin my last road trip, time to move on. There’s no way that 4.7 rating isn’t constantly scrubbed of negative reviews either.",0,
This is one of the best apps for discovering local places and getting from A to B. My biggest complaint with this app is how it constantly directs me to use toll roads!!! I have to constantly turn “avoid tolls” off and back on to get it to reroute. Even still it will sometimes not reroute and demand I use the toll road. The funny part is sometimes I will zoom in and see the street name include “tollway”!!!! Aside from this it works great.,0,
Many main roads in critical places down town and nasr city etc... have already changed from 2 ways roads into oneway road long time ago and still appears as it was on the maps . Also diversions from and into Cairo ring road and Suez road still isn’t so clear on the maps and losing it makes the journey so much longer,0,
"I don’t know what happened to Google Maps, but it is absolutely horrible now! It always takes me to the wrong places, doesn’t give me correct street names, and doesn’t call out directions while I’m driving like it should. It always loses my location and tries to tell me to make unnecessary moves to get to where I already am! So frustrating! This used to be my go-to maps service, but my Apple Maps works exponentially better than Google now, so I deleted my Google Maps app completely from my phone. I won’t be using it anymore.",0,
"Not sure why, tried many things closing and restarting, tweaked every related setting in Settings, but no luck. So sometimes it just does not work. Its sad, it lets you down exactly when you need it most. One example, if I click on location in Google Calendar, it leads me to Google Maps, but then it says “offline” or something. It cannot find location and cannot start navigation. Hopefully that bug gets fixed soon.",0,
"I’m a delivery driver. I prefer this over apple maps even though I have an iPhone because it actually shows me the address once I arrive (apple doesn’t). But it’s very glitchy, reroutes frequently for no reason, and I keep setting it to “avoid tolls” and I check “remember setting” but it doesn’t remember the setting. I have to double check every route to make sure it’s not using a toll road and that’s very frustrating. I’d be more than happy to change my rating if these problems were fixed. I love it otherwise",0,
"What’s going on with the last versions? I can’t even access the Commute tab anymore because I don’t have / don’t want to provide a work/school address. Still, I always used the Commute tab to check traffic conditions, but now Google Maps won’t allow me to access that as it keeps asking me for a work/school address. Hoping this will be fixed so my 5 stars will be back! Update: tried to uninstall and install the app again as the developers suggested in the reply below but the issue persists. Very annoying!",1,This is an issue we hear about from time to time. One thing that has helped some users is clearing your phone's cache and uninstalling Google Maps from your device and then reinstalling it fresh from the App Store. This will ensure you have a clean install. More details on clearing cache can be found here:https://goo.gl/GW6uOo.
When driving in the highway or busied streets it announces the the next exit but it doesn’t say the direction to to turn. It announces the directions when you are almost at the exit and is difficult to turn right or left because of the heaviest traffic.

I went for an eye exam today and couldn’t believe how nice and helpful the staff is. They optometrist was very friendly and professional as well as the staff who helped me with making a decision on my frames. On a scale from 1 to 10 I would definitely give them an 11. I highly recommend them and definitely will be back in the future!😀👍,0,
You guys just keep getter and better even out in the middle of no place your very accurate. I do wish that I could search for two things at the same time so that the map showed two pins at the same time so that I could see how close they were and know which one to go to first more quickly.,0,
"I’ve been Favoriting a lot of things and making lists for an upcoming trip and I love how easy it is to keep organized. It’s very helpful. However, now when I pull up my lists, they don’t show up on the map. I know that I can un/reinstall the app but is this going to keep happening? I seem to have this issue on my iPhone but not on my iPad.",1,"Thank you for your patience as we worked on this problem. With the latest app release, this issue should now be resolved, and your saved locations should once again be visible.

"I have navigated thru many places with Google maps. Especially when it comes to looking for hidden spots, bars and restaurants, it’s amazing. Every city I have been to is full of stars where I absolutely loved! The information about businesses are very helpful too, and most of the time quite accurate.",0,
"I have used and loved Google maps for ever! However, lately the app has been playing an ugly game on me. I’m always used to switching out from the app, going to others (checking messages or even just closing my phone) and then switching back to maps. Lately (the last few months) when I try to switch out and back in, the app crashes and i have to re-enter my destination etc.",1,"2/27/18 Did this resolve your concerns? 1/25/18 Thank you for letting us know about this issue, and your patience as we fixed the problem.

"When I open Google Sheets they do not match the title or look the same as the Sheets document when it is open on my computer. I am looking at data from the completely wrong year. Luckily I double check the data using my computer.  This error needs to be fixed. Because the Sheets are likely duplicated from year to year, retitled and edited, I'm thinking that the error could be related to duplication. I downloaded Sheets in a separate app, but I would prefer to be able to access everything from my drive.",0,
"Been using the app for years, its better than apple maps but thats not saying much.  They keep adding more features which clutter the screen up, and as of late when you try to start navigation the start button doesnt work unless you slide the turn by turn tray up. Happens on both me and my wife’s phone. Stopping messing with an originally good app.  I just get less impressed each update.",0,
"I have similar issues described by Norway772. Sometimes takes minutes to update starting location. Occasionally freezes causing me to miss exits. Seems google is adding features at the expense of speedy, reliable directions. Would MUCH prefer an app that at least has an option for basic directions, fast accurate position, and timely instructions ... with no other frills.",0,
"I have used this app all over the world. There have been times when we hit a surprising dirt road but 99% of the time Google Maps is right on the money, from the back roads of Accra Ghana to downtown Manhattan it have been a life saver. Once in Split, Croatia it literally saved a life a we were directed to a hospital that could treat an allergic reaction. Smart, accurate, informative and fun. Love it.",0,
"Google map used to be the best map app out there for years. Now it seems to be worse than Apple maps day-one!!! It’s so confused and lost lately(last few months)! I have tested it on different iPhones models and they are all inaccurate. It’s really dangerous using it while driving. It either keeps re-routing or the arrow hovers over the map loosely. Can’t you just fix it? Should all the user switch to other maps until you guys decide to fix it? Google map is not just an app these days, it’s a tool and it has to work accurately.",1,"Thank you for letting us know about this issue, and your patience as we fixed the problem. We appreciate it! With the latest update, Google Maps should now be working as usual."
"Sometimes this app is about the dumbest app on my phone. I try to find a certain town in my state and it will bring up other towns with same name in other states. How ignorant is this? So I go to the google app and type the same town and brings up the town I was looking for with description of the town with a google map icon under it, so I click the map icon and it brings up the town on google maps. Stupidest thing I ever seen.",0,
Google maps never disappoint but I’m having an issue with the microphone when using the app in Apple Carplay.  It comes on when I hit the microphone icon inside the google maps app in Carplay but  it doesn’t detect my voice.  I’ve checked settings in my iPhone and my car. The microphone works for all other apps and the Acura Navi.  Probably a bug conflict between Apple Carplay and Google Maps app.  ??,0,
"Please make the search capabilities more intuitive. If i have to find directions for a place while I’m driving, the first results should be for the closest places, not from a state I visited a week ago thats all the way across the country. Also, Allow the ability to filter results based on distance. Idk why that needs to be said. I would almost always want to see whats closest to me before something farther away.",0,
"So if your looking for directions, food, hotels, etc, this app is for you! If you like me, and want to street view places, then I’d go with Google Earth. I personally like Google Earth better, because it’s a lot faster, and easier to use. Google Maps gives you lots of information on a business too. Take these into  consideration. Or if you really want to, try them both and see what you prefer.",1,Thank you for your review! We appreciate it and are pleased to hear you are enjoying Google Maps!
Went in looking for a dress for a wedding didn’t want to spend a lot but wanted a fancy with a little bling. The sales associate Was able to help size me and find exactly what I wanted.

"I used the google maps app on every phone before my iPhone X. However, when I got my iPhone X, the app was giving me the black bars. I had to find another app to replace until the app was updated. Any app I found did not measure up to the ease of use and quality of this app! I’m so glad the app was updated.",0,
"I started to use Google map on iPhone X. However, all my saved places is not marked on big map as before. I need to zoom in to very big, then I can see them. I have no idea if I operated incorrectly or this is a bug. Please let me know if I need to change some settings to see them in a wide size map. For example, I could see the places I saved when I can see whole United States...

When attempting to figure out the fastest and easiest way to get to a place by public transportation...I don’t like the fact it includes me getting in a Lyft or Uber and then getting on a bus or train.. if I have enough money for a Lyft or Uber then I’ll just take it all the way to my destination... I want google maps to understand I’m using public transportation and public transportation only... meaning metro buses and trains and walking all the extra just throws off timing and makes everything confusing.,0,
"Google maps is something I use multiple times a day, but recently after I updated it, it has become VERY UNSTABLE, and crashes multiple times in a single session. Also, the lack of contrast in the map is getting really annoying. Maps should have clear contrast, Google’s usage of white and beige for roads is completely baffling here and very user-unfriendly. Please increase the contrast, so we can actually see where the roads are on the map !!!! Thank you",0,
I’ve been working for TrueCare24 for some time now as a provider I can honestly say they do their best to satisfy the client and also you as a provider I would recommend this company both ways as a provider and also for services!

"It’s sad to say that i have to stop using Apple’s Map because there are so many inaccuracies. Apple’s Map took me to wrong locations or told me to turn when there were no roads.

"More robust than Apple Maps, plus it lists more locations and better routes. It is MUCH better at giving traffic details (heavy traffic, delays, obstacles) than Wayz. I absolutely depend on on this app to get me to/from work each day, and for negotiating construction traffic and alternate routes during IH-69 construction.",0,
"Google maps is great when it comes to checking the bus schedules and how bad is traffic but if they are looking for an app to help you get to place n for directions google maps is not it sadly and it ridiculous it would show you the long way, if you take a wrong turn you are on your own it might tell you the street name to turn at but if you are not  familiar with the area then ya you are on your own bc it won’t show on the map",0,
"Other review sites don’t allow honest reviews like google maps , I appreciate google maps allowing true honest reviews both good and bad ... other sites like yelp don’t allow honest bad reviews...

"At 72 &amp; being “old school” I read Thomas Brothers maps habitually, I worked for Stanley Steamr a number of years &amp; what a hoot that was! If Google Maps had existed, my time would’ve been cut down 4 times its size &amp; more! I simply love Google maps &amp; if u don’t have it yet, then get it now, or suffer the consequences of a “ fools game”!",0,
I used to love this app and used it for my trips and adventures but lately it’s been really letting me down. Google maps will take me on completely different roads that I didn’t even need to go down. It’ll glitch out to the point of me completely missing my exit because it reroutes so many times I don’t know where I’m going. My boyfriend has a Samsung and his google maps just updated to where it doesn’t talk anymore it just “dings” when it’s time to turn which makes him have to look at his phone and caused him to almost crash.,0,
"This is by far the best navigation app. HOWEVER, if we choose to avoid highways/tolls, I would like for Google Maps to stop trying to reroute me back onto the highway. That I’ve specifically checked to avoid. There NEEDS to be a “disable faster reroute”option for this app. Give us the options for routes, then when I take the route I want, don’t try to reroute me to a different route that’s faster. I chose this route for a reason, most likely to avoid highways. This needs to be a thing since hands-free laws are taking place I don’t want to have to look a way from the road to just dismiss the auto reroute to a faster option. Make this a thing please!!! I’m sure lots of people agree!",0,
Google maps needs to start telling you when to turn around. I always start going in one direction and it’ll just adjust to going that direction even if it’s an hour longer. It’s awful at pointing you in the right direction to start. Then if you go in the wrong direction it’ll just let you keep going. There has been several times it’s taking me a town or two over just to make me turn around to come back. Insanely frustrating just make allow it to say make a U-turn.,1,"Thank you for your review!

"As a foreigner living in Taipei, Taiwan, I don’t understand why Google maps on their English app put the street names only with Chinese characters . I can’t follow the directions on how to get to a place when the directions say turn right on .... street then turn left on ... street. I have just realized that Apple maps English app is far better. Apple maps uses English letters for street names - not Chinese characters!!!! I could follow the directions very easily. Thus, I’m switching to Apple maps from now on.",0,

"This was a great app for several years but it’s now gone wacky on my iPhone 6. The voice guidance gives one initial direction and then goes silent. The blue navagation arrow is often not correct as well. However, written directions continue correctly. The sound icon is not muted. Bluetooth is turned off in phone and car. I have always done every update for the app. I’ve googled for solutions online but seen none for this problem.",0,
"This GPS is very good, but I miss a speedometer when I am navigating using it. I change my GPS for another one just because this, but Google Maps always are the best for me. I think speedometer it’s necessary because have some roads don’t have any signs indicating the speed limit, and I use this tool to check if I am respecting the law. So, think about my idea, it’s not a new idea, but a good idea to improve the experience with this incredible product.",0,
"Google Maps does not have a way to offer edits to physical locations other than the address. For example, the restaurant I’m sitting in can not be entered from its street address but must be entered from the side street of its corner location. Maps directions send you a mile out of your way to be unable to enter the parking lot from its street address.",0,
I totally enjoyed Google maps. I recently have been uploading all of my food pictures whenever I go out to eat. Amazing that so many people view my pictures. I am almost to 1 million views by tomorrow. I really enjoy add in those pictures as a hobby. I love the statistics and so on. So happy to have Google maps on my iPhone.,0,
I love and use this app everyday. Since the latest update my “starred places” that I labeled show as a star on my map but don’t show the name I have given it. It make finding the locations I have to travel to so much easier if I can see the name. Since the latest update I have to do twice the work to find where I’m going on the map. Can you please fix the issue?,0,
"Not a bad start for CarPlay but there are some issues. I don't see speed limit toggle like others. Maps drift to center when in highway speeds (should be to the right because of signs on left). Favorite saved places don't show labels and just default to address (I don't care for the address, I want to see my label). Google Voice is broken ""take me home"" doesn't work.",1,"Speed limits in navigation should be available in your country! Thank you for your patience as we roll this feature out.

"The first thing to pop up should be the user's choice. It used to be my route to work and back. Then they hid that in the search bar, making it a 2-tap gesture instead of 1. Now, it's hidden behind the stupid ""explore your area"" function. It's still a 2-tap gesture, but I hate having a feature that I never use always popping up first, before the only feature I ever use comes up. They're pushing a feature on me. That's not ok.",0,
"I have the same poor experience now as Zildjiancat’s complaints.  Google Siri just decides to randomly stop telling you when your turn is coming, usually after you past it if at all.

I deliver pizzas. Google maps is extremely reliable. Navigation while in satellite view is something Waze and Apple Maps don’t offer.

"It used to be very good. But lately seeing lot of issues. When I was returning from Vegas to San Jose, google maps suggested an alternate route due to traffic. When I took the suggested route it was woods not even a road. Thankfully I was driving an SUV. Else I would have been screwed with flat tire. In another incident, when I dropped my friend off at San Jose airport its been screaming me to turn when there was no road at all. Then It didnt recognize my location. Closing and reopening the app multiple times didnt help either. I had to use my direction sense to get back home.",1,Can you please tell us a little bit more about what you're experiencing so we can investigate further?
Great maps and navigation! Much better and more up to date than Maps app. Download feature comes in super handy when you travel to another country. You can download a portion of the map ahead of time so you have a detailed map when you travel.,0,
"This was my favorite Nav app but after the last update, I have thrown my phone and fought with my wife more than ever before. It freezes constantly and doesn’t move the map, even after driving for 5 miles, it’ll show me back at the start location or I am 20 miles off the road. The fix, keeping your WiFi on. I have unlimited data, I hardly ever turn my WiFi on because it drains my battery. Tl:Dr - Love this app, now I hate it. It gets me lost and encourages arguments between my wife and I.",0,
"By far better than Apple maps. I love this app and use it all the time when I travel. I love how it takes me to alternative routes when there is traffic and shows me where the traffic is at. Not only that but it also tells me how slow traffic is. Overall, great useful app.",0,

"I do most everything with my Apple Watch. I send text messages, make reminders, and yes, even navigate. The reason being that it’s easy to quickly say, “Hey Siri, quickest driving route to _______.” This is especially true when driving and I don’t have time to type in an address in my phone. While Google Maps tend to be more accurate than Apple Maps, it was the dropping of that interface with my watch that caused me to drop them.",0,
GPS was stuck at an intersection. It would not update. I had to swipe screen along the route to get there. These were highly populated areas in the middle of town. There is no excuse for this behavior. I had to pull over multiple times to read streets. I have always trusted Google but I may go back to Apple maps.,0,
"After going high on data, I looked into my data break down, and noticed google maps using a major part of it. When compared to Waze navigation it use considerably more data with google maps.

Sometimes your body needs a time out. The best way for that is a great massage. It’s relaxing soothing and calming.

I’ve been using Google Maps for the longest time and a few days ago when I would search for the time the bus would come it will tell me to walk and wouldn’t show any times the would come. For example I have to get to school so I put the directions to see what time I should leave and it tells me to walk for 41 minutes instead of giving the bus times. This really needs to be looked at please.,0,
"Your software is now more than ever depending on wifi. I refuse to turn wifi on due to security risks. The phone has a gps chip that google must use as reference for device’s current location. I reinstalled the app two times, cleared my previous locations, and still cannot detect my current location.

This app has been great for years but lately it has been crashing every time I try to do anything extra on it. If I try to add another address to change the song or anything it just stops working. It has been able to do all of these things for years but all of the sudden it forces me to quit out and wait till I can even open it again to retry and usually I get no luck on my 4th or 5th tries and I en up using some other app. Do not download and use this app because it will just make your life harder than it has to be,0,

"When trying to go to/from work, I don’t want to take the dirt and gravel road that the app wants to send me. It is a horrible road that barely gets one car through, let alone two to pass each other. It is fraught with big pot holes, dangerous curves, and big drop offs. So I would like to avoid this “road” even if the app designated it as fastest. Will there ever be an enhancement to include a feature to avoid a certain road or at least dirt and gravel roads?",0,
"Update: Hoorah it’s back! Thanks for the quick fix! — My want to go list now appears as empty in the app, but when I view Google maps on the web my list shows up fine. Tracking places to visit is mainly what I use Google maps for, so this is quite a frustrating issue.",0,
"Google maps is great, I’m also not being paid to say this. But as a new driver this is great for me! It does have some flaws though. Like the fact that it doesn’t have many route options. Other than that it is a very good app for a knew driver, or somebody who is knew to a environment. Over all 4.5 stars, so I boosted it up to five",0,
"Google keeps updating it without proper testing. Last month all of the map disappeared when navigating to a destination, so all you essentially saw was a squiggly line on a blank background. This was partially fixed, but now doing a search, eg, ""coffee"" gives you a list of destinations, but doesn't display them on the map. An ongoing issue is that the map scale disappears after a few seconds. Especially in a wilderness area, a map is pretty much useless without a scale. Not sure why keeping the scale always visible isn't an option.",0,
"I love this app and prefer it to others, but the current update is driving me insane. It takes 30+ seconds for it to recognize I’ve made a turn and  to continue my instructions. By that point I’ve already passed my next step and am left making a U-turn or taking a new, longer route. It often thinks I’m on neighboring roads like service roads when I’m not and will give me instructions that aren’t even compatible with the road I’m on.

"I used it for 2 recent short trips. The first 30 mile west bound trip it tried to make me travel east on I40 four times! It said the trip would take 2 hours 32 minutes. It took 40 minutes. The second trip took 30 minutes to go 21 miles on I40. Google Maps said it would take 2 hours 52 minutes. Google Maps cannot be trusted and is actually dangerous because it tries to turn you 180’ on city streets when it mistakenly takes you off the interstate.

"Google, why did you make it so that I have to tap 3 extra times just to get directions after searching for a destination? In addition, why can I no longer edit what I previously searched on? Seems like we’re stuck back in the 90s and 2000s when UX wasn’t a consideration, should I go back to using MapQuest? I’m still upset about you changing the double-tap &amp; drag up or down to zoom in or out faster, flip flopping it on users without providing an advanced configuration option.",0,
"This app used to work phenomenally until recently. The past several times that I used it (&amp; desperately needed it), it was not only extremely delayed but inaccurate. I thought maybe it was my settings or that I needed to reboot my phone.

I hope that the bugs &amp; issues are fixed or I’ll be resorting back to my mapquest app.",1,Are you still experiencing this issue on version 4.48 of Google Maps?
Idk what happened with this app it use to work for me. It will give me directions few minutes in than just stop. Literally have wasted 2 hours just trying to get to a friend. Have been wasting gas money. It’s a good navagation to take if u want to play the game of getting lost. These updates haven’t even been working.,0,
"Whether the app is open or not, it drains my battery quickly so I have to turn cell data off when not in use. I use google maps on my computer to input the addresses I need, then I forward the route to my phone so I can use the app; however, in translation a majority of the pinpoints are not accurate and it adds more time to my schedule trying to correct what the app has messed up. There are far superior apps out there and I may have to use them.",0,
"This app is great to use and is as smart as a human. It has great photography and is always helpful towards me. I am only twelve years old and I am still very capable of using it. The one negative thing that I could think of would only be the updates, they have to come quicker. Maybe every 6 months, that would be great. Very useful and I would recommend this app to anyone.",0,
"I decided early on that google maps was much better than apple maps. I like all the options to search for destinations. Lately though, google maps has been bugging out, decides not to tell me when to turn, tries to take me down closed streets, and tells me I’ve arrived when I’m passing my destination on the highway. After being super frustrated with rerouting processes, and being late to my destinations, I am done using google maps and am going back to Apple.",0,
"Think this is a great app however, like anything else, there is always room to improve. My two major issues with the mapping is the font size and the outlining of the states. It would be very helpful, if as you zoom into an area of interest, that the font size expands to a larger size. Also would like to see the state lines defined a little more distinctly.",0,
If i connect to apple car play my current location always defaults to a random place and navigates to my destination from there. This is crazy as i thought google maps having some issue but after I unplugged it from CarPlay it worked just fine. Please fix this.,0,
"I loved the fact that I can use Google Maps in Apple CarPlay, but there is one issue. The traffic indicators can’t be turned off. The map in the car screen shows the colored lines indicating traffic conditions by default and I can’t seem to disable them , EVEN when is off and invisible in the phone. I hope this gets fixed as it’s pretty annoying and at times co fusing to follow the route line in the middle of many other colored lines indicating traffic.",0,
"Google maps updated their database about 9 months ago.  Since then our address is linked to a house not only with the a different address but also on a different street,  roughly 3/4 miles away.  We have reported the error repeatedly to google with no response.  At 300 this morning we had to call for an ambulance for my son who stopped breathing.  At 315, dispatch said they could not locate the home.  At 320 they arrived,  apparently the homeowner from the other house knew where we lived and provided directions.",0,
This last update makes you take three or four clicks to turn on the traffic layer every time you open the app.  Crazy-making when you are... IN TRAFFIC! Follow up note-  they fixed the problem and pushed a solution in less than 48 hours!  Spectacular response time-  great job.,1,"Thank you for letting us know about this issue, and your patience as we fixed the problem. We appreciate it! With the latest update, Google Maps should now be working as usual."
Joe helped us out on a Saturday even though he was headed out the door. We were so hot because our air conditioner went out on our road trip. Joe reset the computer and let us know we need a thermometer. Ahhh.....cool and comfortable now thanks to Joe who helped us out even though he was closing and didn't have to. If i lived in Fairfield Joe would def be my car guy.,0,
"Have been using this app for five years and have had a very positive experience.

"Is anyone else having the problem while viewing the directions while driving, it won’t update. But if you’re looking at the directions via the road map, it works perfectly. As soon as you view the actual written directions, it won’t update as you move along. Usually google maps is spot in, but they need to fix this!! I’ve tried it on my moms and sisters phone and same thing happens, the directions won’t update!!",0,
"I like everything about Google maps, but the only thing I can't figure out is how to get that volume to be turned up to the max so that it's louder than all the other volumes on iPhone. I received the response and will try this. But as I explored some of the buttons, I noticed that some of them don't seem to be labeled as I use VoiceOver.",1,"Thanks for your review! To change the volume of the navigation guidance, please follow these steps: Open Google Maps &gt; tap Menu (top left corner) &gt; tap Settings &gt; tap Navigation &gt; under Guidance volume, tap LOUDER."
"Normally google maps is the best option for navigation on the iPhone, but on my 3 hour long drive to a place I am not too familiar with getting to today, it decided to just not work.  It loaded with where I was originally and where I was going without a problem, but then it would not update with my changing location, so I had to keep swiping to see what my next move was.  For someone with traveling anxiety like I have, this was less than desired.  I’ve redone loaded the iPhone maps for the trip back.",0,
"I have used all of the major map programs out there.  There are some anomalies and annoying things about this application, but nothing else even comes close it at this time: 2016. 2019 update . . . so many improvements . . . better than ever &amp; STILL better than any other map app out there!!!",0,

"Not good for cincinnati, ohio. Reroutes in the middle of following the correct directions. Then reroutes back to the original directions for no apparent reason. “In 1 mile turn left on reading rd” *rerouting* “ In half a mile turn right onto cooper rd” *30 seconds later rerouting again* “In 1 mile turn right onto reading rd” Like come on! That’s an accident waiting to happen. Then today as I was going to my doctors appointment it routed me into someone’s home driveway. I will be trying other apps until google can fix these glitches that’s been happening for a very long time.",0,
It will be great if I leave from point (A)to get to point (B) and you forget where you came from to be able to have an option to have a route for the previous place you were at. I sometimes have to go from cite to cite as a construction worker and forget where I originally came from.,0,
"Good map program but Google Map, please add two things. 1) make a mapping only mode where you can maybe not like, be sitting on your couch with people around then all of a sudden google is telling you to head north on 6th st. 2) let me choose when you start giving me directions, so I don’t have to listen to you tell me how to drive through my hometown until I get to the exit.",0,
"I could not function without Google maps. Regardless of what where I am, this feature gets me to wherever else I might need to get to next, without fail. It has saved me countless times from being lost. Can't live without it. Thank you Google maps for driving security!",0,
Google maps is better than MapQuest but I have to say they do need to update their laws on the GPS traffic because a few times the GPS told me to make a right down a one-way street almost causing a really bad accident wake up Google maps and know the law!,0,
"Before GMaps were standard. And still nowadays I’d say desktop version is good and useful. But Google definitely lost the game with this one. At least on iOS devices. Mobile app is infested with ads and erratic behavior + in Vietnam where I live for the moment too many misguiding and riding in circles. I am not a fan of ios Maps but they are absolutely superior, clutter free and precise despite the bugs. I keep GMaps on the phone just because of compatibility ( sending links from desktop to phone). Otherwise I’d delete them and never look back...",0,

I have no idea what is going on with this app but when I’m literally on the main road in my town and yet every time I put in an address to go to clients house this app can’t find my start location at all. I’m sitting at my work just put in my home address to rest out and see if reinstalling app would fix the problem and it literally can’t find my location .. I’m right on the main road dabney drive you either turn right or left on it to get to my house and this app has me starting on some state road nowhere near here,0,
"Although the app is quite good at providing direction, it lacks public transportation information. I am in the Netherlands and was looking for a location. Once found, I wanted to know where that was in relation to the train station. However, the train station nor the display of tracks was shown on the map. I often encounter this problem when I use this map app and need to switch to the Apple map app.",0,
"I always have my map in satellite mode with the transit layer selected, but recently it stopped working unless I switch to default. What happened? I can’t find any info about this online or in google help specifically. I need to see my train lines in satellite mode!

"I worked with quads, nautical charts and maps for over fifty years in work and recreation. The most difficult thing with maps was not only finding where the object of your search was but where amongst all those lines and characters where you yourself might be. With google maps I can pan past the unfamiliar until I find where I am headed then get a choice of roots. Seventy years ago I knew computers were coming and fifty years ago began to use them at work.

"Google Maps allows one to input multiple location addresses under “My Destinations”. Very useful when you want directions for these pre-planned destinations. This function was working up until a week ago. Now the app no longer displays the directions button. So I can only see the address on the map but I cannot click on it for directions from where I’m presently located. This has basically crippled the app for my purposes. Google, please fix this error!",0,
"Google maps used to be my preferred navigation app, but lately it routinely shows travel routes 15 minutes-an hour longer than a trip takes. I don't feel like I can trust it at all. It has been woefully inaccurate as far as getting me to the entrance of a place as well. Where I used to exclusively use it as my navigation app, I now almost never even bother to check it before a trip because I know apple maps will get me there faster and more accurately. Step up your game, Google. I expected better from you.",0,
"Always though Apple Maps was superior for easy of use, but this nails it for functionality and cross platform location sharing. Live loving sharing. Very useful with my iPad Pro 10.5 mounted in car.

"Used this for years. Never had a problem. Don’t know if it was recent update. But it kept taking to a place not even close to where I needed to be. It kept saying I had to drive 14 hours for a 1 hour drive. I followed the route for 10-15 minutes till I realized it was wrong. Another day I searched for a close McDonald’s. It said it was a mile and a half away. But yet a hour drive. What happened? A bug in the recent update?? I’ll try again in a few days and change my review if it’s working correctly. For now, I have to use another app",0,
That feature needs to be changed so that if you ignore the prompt it will stay on current route and click accept if you want it instead of the other way around. I drive a truck and use various other apps while moving and when this pops up I have to quickly switch back to Maps to ignore it. I have missed my turn before due to this and driving a large box truck can be very tricky if you end up on the wrong road. We don’t always want the fastest route. iPhone 7 Plus iOS 11.4.1,0,
Last update just let me delete recents to clean up during my travels. Now my entire account is linked and I have to delete every recent activity individually again or day by day.  Go back to how it just was and I had been waiting for so long to clean up that way! Every thing else is up to google standards and what I love about google maps. Update: still can’t figure out why I can’t get my saved addresses to show up anymore. Long term app is about to be repacked with something that has what I need. Sorry google.,0,
"iPhone X compatibility!!!! FINALLY!!! :) *************** Absolutely love the recent update to this app! Thank you Google. Maps looks and functions very well. This is my go to app for calling businesses, finding out if a business is open at a certain time, and for finding my way around (of course). Apple maps can't even compete.",1,"Thank you for your feedback and patience! With the latest update, you'll find iPhone X support in Google Maps!"
The app has had terrible jumping issues for the last year or so. My arrow should jump forwards and backwards while navigating and it was super annoying. It is finally gone with this update. I can’t believe it. It’s finally smooth again! I will actually go back to using it again. Thanks!,0,
"I had always used Apple Maps beforehand and never had problems, but a friend suggested that I use Google Maps instead. Within 5 minutes, the app was giving me incorrect directions, my arrow(shown position) was fluctuating all over the place, and it told me twice to go onto streets that didn’t exist. I tried to let it go, but shortly after it refused to update my location for a solid 15 minutes. I immediately switched backed to Apple Maps and,  will never use this garbage app again.",0,
"First off, I generally use Waze which is owned by Google. Both Waze and Apple Maps have a dark mode so I don’t understand why google doesn’t have it. The biggest navigation issue I have with google is that they don’t use the freeway numbers. They tend to use freeway names instead which gets confusing here in California. Use freeway numbers and street names for exits and everything will be less confusing.",0,
"I have been using google maps for a long time and I really like it.

"I will absolutely not trust Apple. Google Maps is my Go-To always.

"Google Maps is still my “go to” maps program. But the latest update includes alerts such as “disabled vehicles.” I don’t mind that addition, but the should be a way to TURN IT OFF or hide it. When planning a travel route, the screen is cluttered with DV icons, which is meaningless information. Clearly Google is falling into a trap of taking an excellent program and cluttering it with tools that are useless.",0,
"Last night Google maps took me three different places, the last place being the correct address. It took me more than 3 miles in the opposite direction and once it got me there it put me on both sides of the highway and dad in subdivisions. The last subdivision that dead-end it was at a construction site. And I switch from Apple because they have problems my first night at google was horrible!",0,
"After updating to this app, all my custom map icons no longer display in this application, making this feature useless. I use this long touted and supported feature to build travel maps for work / personal travel  and this is now no longer functional. I have 100s of hours invested in these maps. It still works fine via Safari (desktop and iOS). It seems intentional that a key supported feature would be completely broken and this product would be released without any notice. If so, this is extremely bad faith. I hope it is addressed in a bug fix release. If not, this would be a real deal breaker for my consistent Google Map advocacy and make it hard to recommend its use for any critical activity besides the standard to / from usage supported.",1,"We appreciate you letting us know about this issue, and we thank you for your patience as we worked on the problem. With the latest app release, this issue should be fixed and should now be working as usual."
"At some point in last couple of months the app started acting up. When I try to use my current location it puts me anywhere near my location (NOT MY LOCATION) and I have to manually look at my next direction because it lags with telling me my next direction. For example, I will make a turn within 400 ft and it will keep that same direction for 5-10 minutes. This app is no longer reliable. I don’t know what y’all have to do but I’m now considering WAZE because this app is giving me a headache and getting me lost.",0,

If I could give Zero reviews I would this. This app is absolutely horrible I was on my way to an important event and I’m now delayed 30 additional minutes stuck in traffic because Google maps can’t decide one street from the next. please be advises this is not the app that you need when you’re trying to get from point a to point B because they will get you lost. Google is worth too much money to be having these issues. I will no longer be using this app and neither will my friends or family. Thanks.,0,
"I think the newest update came with a bug because every time that I’ve used it since the last update, whenever i try to open up the directions list, the app just closes. I figured it was just my phone until my girlfriend tried navigating us somewhere and i heard her say “what the heck”. I asked her if the app crashed on her and she said it did when she tried opening up the directions.",0,
"Google Maps has an unparalleled location database, but the driving navigation has deteriorated over time. Most recently the issue that persists is the lag in providing the next turn. You will reach the point where you need to exit or make a turn, but the app is still showing you the previous instruction...not helpful at all and I’ve missed almost every turn after the most recent update.",0,
"This app has been indispensable while traveling, and was completely reliable up until this recent update. Now when I switch to another app while mapping and come back the icon to center on my current location disappears, forcing me to go back and remap to get the icon back. The layers icon to change your graphical view of the map is also gone, not sure where it went.",0,
Google maps is a good gps system until there is Lag on exits and ramps which effects my  timing and forcing me to have to turn around. Also there is a long delay on calculating traffic jams.. So for example it’ll say take i10 instead it’s 14 mins faster.. When get on i10 it changed its calculations to oh there will be a 30 min delay change.. So that irks the life out of me when google does that.. these last min oops are costly,1,Thanks for your review!

"Why would you guys take away the feature that allows us to choose which location you want to go depending on traffic- let’s say you have more then one address that you need to go to..  the feature was when you press exit when you have your destination to go to and it give you all of your address that you need to go, there you can change which one you can go to by the time frame to avoid traffic..  now I have 5 address and I don’t know which way to go the fastest.

"I used to love Google Maps but recently it has been extremely glitchy and completely inaccurate. I live in a moderately-sized city in Ohio and was trying to send a friend directions to where I was, and the directions said it would take 21 hours from a location that was at most, 15 minutes away. I thought this was an isolated incident, but it has happened a separate 3-4 times and thus has made the app unreliable. I will be reverting to Apple Maps until these bugs are fixed. Very disappointed with Google.",1,Sorry to hear about this issue. Are you still experiencing this on version 4.48 of Google Maps?

"I have been using this app for my drive to work for three years now. The truth is that this app is not capable of accurately calculating drive times for a morning or afternoon commute.

It just can not calculate times accurately during the hours of 7am-9am.",0,
Impressive app but still need some more to get the best. The first thing I think really needs to add is speed limit and show the speed.

It’s quick to zoom in and out and back to your location if you scroll ahead, lots of positives, but with the last update it was ruined. I cannot see traffic conditions and it keeps asking me to login.  It’s now useless to me, I now recommend Waze and apple maps.

It's a great app in but there are things that make it really annoying like the explore food and drinks bar bouncing when you start so I miss touch the go button. I also wish you could just there was a way to tap to your favorites or labeled pins from the map but instead history is there. Cumbersome to either search by text or to open the menu and select my places.

This is a great app for turn by turn directions.  It does get it's north south east and west mixed up sometimes telling you to turn left when it means right and vice versa.

I love the app but noticed I would you use it more often if it had an app for Apple Watch since I like getting the directions of where I’m going on my watch. I can do that using maps from Apple but not from this one. It’s the only thing I would like to see coming next for this app.,0,
"When you have a single-stop trip gmaps shows travel time and distance (in miles). However, when you add stops to your trip, it shows travel time only and the distance disappears.

Every time you go to maps now it automatically zooms in on where you are. Then you have to zoom back out and navigate back to what you want to look at. Then five minutes later when you come back it again zooms in on where you are forcing you to renavigate back to what you want to look at.

"Last couple of versions have changed the behavior of the app. When using Apple shortcuts with “Heading to Work” shortcut, Google maps is opened as it should but when the ‘work’ address is passed, Google Maps just spins and spins.... clicking the destination field and entering the same address manually maps out the destination. It just doesn’t work when being passed as a variable.",0,
Google map not trustable anymore the last versions made that product to a danger and safe for use and he can cause your debt if you use it in the highways and freeways it’s completely deceiving And before you use it you should know that is not safe anymore. Get to the time to make the new Google map because it’s not getting better with Google only worse and worse,0,
Right now my google maps app constantly crashes on my iPhone 6s as well as it’s not as responsive. I understand my phone is old.

I absolutely hate the latest version of maps. With just one swipe I can navigate to my home and workplace with ease. Now I have to connect my google account and have my web activity on just to get directions?! I don’t appreciate google tracking my every move for their convenience even when I’m just looking up a nearby restaurant. I just want the fastest route to my destination. Please take this “commute” option away to make my life simple! I miss the old (5.1 version) google maps 😔,0,

"when using public transport, the app used to show the times of arrival for different buses or trains (say route A and B) separately, the individual times of arrival clear. now, it combines routes A and B and will only show one route's schedule. i don't know if that's clear, but now i'm unable to see if the other bus/etc is about to arrive because it only shows me one route. i use public transport all the time and it's not helpful anymore",0,
"Google Maps is leaking information to law enforcement. It wouldn’t be a big deal until you consider the ability for any of us to be falsely accused of a crime based on police officers attempting to digest complex and copious location data to solve a crime instead of, you know, getting out there and solving a crime. Google maps is a great product. Functionally, it is superior to Apple Maps. That said, I’m deleting google maps and will be using Apple for the simple reason that they don’t (can’t) provide location data to law enforcement or anyone else.",0,
"Ever since the iOS 13.1 upgrade on my iPhone XR Google maps acting like I have to know better where I am going than the app, constantly showing the inaccurate information about the routes in the notification area, not matching the actual rout on the map itself, so one have use an iPad to be able to see where one needs to go. Please fix it Google!",0,
Maps use to never do this but now when you start it takes a long time for it to know where you’re pointed and tell you to go the wrong way from the start and it can add some time to your trip. In addition it’s been more confusing lately about what routes to take weird changing to a route that’s 20 or 30 minutes longer for no reason.,0,
"I was just exploring different places such as London in Google Maps, and noticed that user and company submitted photos are pixelated.

I also checked using cellular data, and the problem still persist.",0,
"The “Explore Nearby” feature of google maps wastes so much space on my screen that it’s hard to actually see the map.

I used to love Google Maps but now it can hardly read my location. It’ll put me on roads I’m not on and on the other side of the highway. It takes forever to update and redirect. I hate using Apple Maps and was a huge advocate for Google but lately the changes have made it worse and I can’t even get to my destination without getting lost. I’m pretty much reading the map for myself. Please fix this!!! I want to keep using it but I can’t if it can’t even tell me where I am :(,1,Thanks for your review!

"I use this app a lot. However, I am concerned about trusting it’s directions lately. Today I entered the address I was going to and it wanted me to turn left and go around an entire country block out my driveway instead of simply having me turn right. Then, it directed me to head on 65 South (which wasn’t even an option) instead of going 65 North. Fortunately, I knew basically where I was going. Hope the kinks get worked out ASAP!",0,

"Long ago this use to be a good gps for directions. It may be good to find a restaurant or something like that, but if you are traveling and you want the best route DO NOT USE THIS APP OR THE WAZE APP!!! I use to love both. Now, these apps send me off of the main routes on back curvy roads or light heavy stop and go areas. I assume because it may be 30 sec quicker??? No one want these routes, they are more difficult and more stressful routes. This is has been a constant problem over the past 3 years.

"I love to use this map. Unreplaceable. However sometimes it direct wrong. When Im moving north and the node of phone go straight toward, the arrow on the map says Im heading to north east while Default map (iphone) does not.

"I like this app; shows my correct location as well as providing accurate local traffic conditions; however, when I want to search for a place, it usually shows the ‘nearest’ one more than 200 miles away!! How can I fix this so I can find a place only a few miles away (or even 200 YARDS away)??",0,
"Why did Google stop differentiating between freeways and regular highways? They’re now both the same color? Also, the much reduced contrast now makes the maps more difficult to read, especially in sunlight. Do the people who redesigned this app actually use it?

It “used” to be a good navigation app but it gets really annoying when the routes are not simple. Getting around a city with google is a pain because it takes me through way too many turns and different streets.

I really like using google because it’s easy to navigate within the app but it doesn’t provide simple navigation on the road.,0,

"As a Private Driver, I rely heavily on navigation to do my job. I recently switched back to Apple Maps and haven't looked back since. Literally every single ride I gave using Google Maps had me take at least 1 wrong/unnecessary turn! New conspiracy going around that Google hopped in bed with big oil and the extra driving is to waste more fuel. I laughed when I heard this months ago, now, I think that conspiracy is as good an explanation as the next. P.S. I'm not alone in this frustration as many Lyft &amp; Uber drivers have had the same issues!",0,
"I travel a lot and Google Maps is a life saver. I recently was riding with a friend and their car GPS told them what the current speed is, so the data is out there.

Been using google maps before it was cool. 😎 now that iOS 11 has come out Apple has made some major improvements that has me using them now. One thing I ask that I think is way overdue from you guys is speed limits. Please add them to our routes. It’s the little things that matter. :),0,

"Updated- They fixed the awkward iPhone X setting! Thanks, google! Having everything swipe up from the bottom is really finicky on the iPhone X, I keep getting google’s function instead of my phone’s.

I use this app every day for pretty much everything.  The one thing that I will love seeing them do is to enhance it so truck drivers like me can use on truck routes.  I don’t know if that is a option yet or is even possible. But that will be awesome. I have to go some routes with my semi sometimes that are a bit tight.,0,
I have experienced more navigation mistakes with this app over the past few months taking me the wrong way or the roundabout way. Sometimes it goes crazy and tells me the next turn 5 times in a row or gives me repeated instructions but each is different like the app can’t find me. Plus I hate the latest icon. Does not look like a map icon. Starting to use Apple Maps more often now because of the above issues.,0,
"Google maps has slowly turned into those 1999 spam pop up ads. They have been planning one big annoying pop up ad this entire time. The user interface is horrible, so many suggestions and pop ups (explore). Please add an option to allow users to remove all this.

Apple has a very modern and simple interface that is much more user friendly.",0,
"I really only use google maps, but recently I’ve gone on several road trips and found myself ready to give up. Why does the app give you the option to choose the route you’d like to take i.e. a scenic route, and then change it for you two second later! I spent hours denying messages that wanted to change my route on my 20+ hour road trip and then on my partners phone, it wouldn’t even ask to change the route, it just would and you couldn’t stop it. It’s incredibly frustrating and, especially if you’re alone, dangerous because you spend so much time trying to stop your phone from sending you in the wrong direction that you aren’t watching the road.",0,
Google is a great tool I use it to Oman trip to campgrounds and rv resorts in Ca fir my weekend get aways.

Now sometimes the search doesn’t pull up the distance so you can’t see how far away it is.

"Recent update made “avoid tolls” not work. It will give you one route option, in the most recent case nearly $10 worth of tolls, Waze found a route without tolls that was 5 mins faster. Edit: Still experiencing this. Can be solved by turning “avoid tolls” off then loading route. Then exit navigation and turn “avoid tolls” back on, now it will avoid tolls. It will not save the setting so you have to do this for the next route you try to navigate...pretty annoying. Waze and Apple Maps are better options.",1,Thanks for letting us know about this issue!

It's a good resource to have when you need directions. My two biggest gripes are that it tries to force you to redirect routes. If I choose a specific route there is a reason for it.

You're not good at it, makes your apps aggravating, &amp; it just makes me seek alternatives.",0,
"Since the update, not sure what they did but i guess they moved the directional pop-ups to the bottom of the screen or something but it keeps getting in the way and makes it really hard to see where the arrow on the map is going. I don't remember how it was before but it was definitely better and there were no problems. Also, directions keep freezing. When you are on the road this is really crucial.",0,
"I see that the “depart later” option is available. I’ve googled it. But I can’t get it on my app. I deleted it and reinstalled. No luck. I want to be able to tell google maps “please don’t send me this way again.” I’ve waited at too many intersections for a left turn with no turn signal that have added a full ten minutes to my commute beyond what the app predicted. I don’t want to make left turns across major streets without traffic lights, either.",0,
"If I was able to rate this app with zero stars, I would. This app LAGS, constantly points me in the opposite direction, will have me make three left turns instead of making one simple right, will suggest a route that’s five minutes longer even though it’s clear that there is more efficient routing, has my starting location freeze to one spot that I’m miles away from. Google is one of the biggest companies in the world and this is how one of their apps work on a consistent basis? Ridiculous.",0,
I have been using and swearing by google maps for work for YEARS! I would literally would tell people to stop using Waze or Apple Maps because google maps was just really good with traffic and times are 99% spot on... BUT Now it is completely unusable as it will redirect me even when I’m on the correct path and it will take ages to update... it has not been fixed with the recent updates and for now have to stop using it because it is completely unreliable.,0,
It is 100% accurate mapping regardless of country or region or location. It is very user friendly and providing technologically advanced features. I think there is no comparison in the market for this product. I simply recommend everyone to use Google Maps and enjoy every feature of it Regards Hitarth,0,

"I love the offline maps and the accuracy of google maps, but I wish I could just look at my watch to know where to turn while driving. Unlike the stock Apple Maps, google maps gets me exactly where I want to go. 1-in-10 of my experiences with Apple Maps usually involves a serious miss calculation and I end up 5+ miles away from the intended location.",0,
Love Love Love Google maps!  As far as I have used Maps which has been a few years already I have never had a problem with it.  I love that I cannot get lost because when you take the wrong turn it will reroute you.  One of the best apps you can have without regrets!!!,0,
Google maps after google acquired wayz has just continued to improve leaps and bounds over ever other possible map offering.  Their local guide feature makes sure all location information is relevant and accurate.,0,
"I like the app way better than other apps like Waze and Apple maps. Yet, I have a consistent problem with the your location aspect of the app. It always shows me in a location in that I am not at. It’ll show me like 2 blocks away instead of where im at. Also when I get somewhere it tells me I’ve arrived like 5 houses before I’m actually there.",0,
"I used to like Google maps but for me it went from good to crappy. Don’t know what happened. Hard to adjust and read. Directions for to/from get stuck. Tabs way to small. I did not request travel via train, kept trying to click by car. Last time I used it was also disappointing. Took us round in circle back to a previous destination when we tried inputting where we wanted to go next.",0,
Above and beyond? Are you kidding me you fools out there? It constantly takes me on the most Outrageous roundabout route that one could possibly ever think of and the longest route ever! It takes me 30 minutes to get to work daily I left early one day and the route that it took me on was 45 minutes! That’s just one of many ridiculous incidents not to mention it will take you a mile out of the way to make you take a U-turn instead of having you turn left which is completely permissible on every friggin road on earth!,1,"Thank you for your review!

"I just did the update again, since I’ve been having issues with this app, it’s been over a month . I need my GPS, it is not finding my correct location, my service is fine I’ve contacted them and I’ve done contacted y’all and I have not heard anything, I need my GPS  it is putting me about 6 miles away and is not tracking my driving, I use my GPS at least three times a week if not more, and I’m about to make a 2500 mile drive one  way I need my GPS I love Google maps but not when it’s like this.",0,
"I’ve tried using other map apps, but none compare to Google maps. The ability to get me to where I need to go as fast as possible is great. I know I will always get there and the time to get there is almost exactly correct . I recommend everyone use it",0,
"I use Google maps exclusively for my navigation needs, however when I’m in a semi truck it has a tendency to route me on non-truck friendly routes.  Would there be a way to develop an option to avoid roads that are restricted to heavy truck traffic?  Other than that, awesome product, far superior to Apple maps.",0,
It’s ok at navigating but it still takes me the wrong way.  Also uploads my pictures to the locations I’ve visited with out my permission!!! Very disappointed I’m using another map for when I travel. Please remove the pictures that were posted on the site at the Eagle Pass Texas Kingdom Hall   I’ve requested them to be removed as the pictures are on the wrong site and Copyrighted. If you don’t remove them I will delete your app and recommend everyone else to do too!!,0,

"No doubt this is the goto map App. However, if I had a buck for every time my thumb hit the current location button I wouldn’t need to work anymore. When you are slewing the map that current location button is so easy to hit and then you zip right back to where you are. Really annoying! Otherwise Google Maps and App Rock!",0,
Most part of my job is driving and i use google maps for navigating around the city and further. Since the last update i feel maps are not correct it doesn’t show arrows for turns or exits... never says the exit names instead shows the next street to merge on after the exit.. I completely rely on google maps and making wrong turns or missing exits is not good at all.. hope they fix the bug..,0,
"The newest update has completely broken navigation.  I almost missed several exits on my last road trip because voice alerts are completely broken.  It either didn’t alert me to a freeway exit or alerted me for the first time with .5 miles to go until the exit on several exits.  It was 100% reliable before and now it’s completely dangerous, forcing split second decisions on drivers because it’s not alerting them in a timely fashion.  Fix this ASAP or I’ll have to switch to Apple Maps.",0,
It’s my go to app for maps. I like how it displays the speed limits however not all the time and at rare times they are incorrect. One improvement that I would love to see is being able to download maps that start at different locations. Would definitely save some data. Other than those minor issues it’s great.,0,
"I just switch to a new iPhone recently, and now the timeline doesn’t work because it says “the location history is not available for this device” I already turn on all the buttons, iOS and maps are all up to date, I don’t know why it just keep saying it’s not available???? Pls help me",0,
"I keep trying to give Apple Maps a shot, but it is still a sub-par experience. Google Maps continues to be the leader in this space by a huge margin. This is especially noticeable in points of interests — Apple Maps is still missing tons of businesses. Google now has info about how busy a place is, what kind of parking they have, etc. Its easily 5-10 years ahead of Apple. Their traffic re-routing is better. Something as simple as searching within Apple Maps shows how painfully bad Apple is at search and discovery. Apple Maps dependence on Yelp for reviews is also a poor move.",0,
"New update is full of bugs. The app isn’t responding to touch input sometimes and other times it is overly responsive to things to input. Wait it gets worse, when I don’t have a destination set the input acts up (I would refer to it as a malfunction because it acts if there is touch input but my phone is in my cup holder mount and nothing is against the screen at all)",0,
"Using an iPhone 6s. For the love of God! Will you fix the lag/ lock up during navigation? Sometimes voice directions work, sometimes they don’t. Sometimes the app gets confused and shows the wrong direction. For crying out loud, you’re Google! Your supposed to have the best, most brilliant minds working for you and you can’t seem to get a navigation app to work right? How many updates have you done now and this stuff keeps happening!",0,
"As someone who drives for a rideshare company, I am sick and tired of this app sucking my phone battery dry even when it’s plugged into the charger in my car! Update***when”she” is giving directions, she says stay left at the fourth, instead of stay left at the fork. When it comes to staying right at the fork, she said stay right at the fork. This might be very anal to point out, but I hear it every single day, and it drives me a little crazy.",0,
Finally having the green light to be used in Apple CarPlay it’s a nice addition. I really like the 3D maps feature which is fun. The interface looks great and easy to use while in CarPlay. At the moment I’m unable to use the microphone to be completely hands free while driving. It doesn’t recognize any sound when plugged in using CarPlay. Hopefully this is a simple fix.,0,
It’s very disconcerting when aero doesn’t point in the direction of the car. The map is set up to point north and if I’m going south the arrow goes down the map. Really hard to follow while you’re driving. I can’t find a setting to change it back to the way used to be. The only reason I use it is because it’s the only one that will display on my car display screen.,0,
"Accurate, real time and available offline as well. Traffic update helps you to get wherever you want on time. You can find anything be it specific restaurant, club or emergency services and many more. Keeps the history as well so you can just recall the place you visited.",0,
"I gotta say, being rerouted IN THE MIDDLE OF A TRIP isn't fun. It more than doubled my trip time and it didn't seem to have any rhyme or reason to it. Also, it doesn’t actually get you anywhere faster. I selected a route to work yesterday that Google seemed to think would get me there in about 40 minutes, counting traffic lights and the congestion in the city. It took an hour and a half. Thanks for nothing. Maybe you can get those not-busy-anymore Google+ engineers to pop over and figure it out for you.",0,
"This app was what I relied on in the past but lately it's been absolutely AWFUL! It attempts to avoid traffic and ends up having me make difficult and dangerous turns, or gives me complex routes! The WORST is when I make a wrong turn, it will notify me to ""turn on A Street"" AFTER I have passed ""A Street"". Now I have to just look at the directions, memorize them, and do the navigation myself. But yes, making the app function like Yelp is MUCH more important than its ACTUAL PURPOSE!",0,
"I use Google Maps daily for my commute to and from work. It was a simple click at the bottom of the home screen followed by one more for either “Work” or “Home”. With this update, I can still get to this but with several more clicks. Why make a simple thing complicated?  Fewer distractions for drivers trying to get going on the road would make sense, right?  Please revert this function.",0,
"Since updating, all my custom pins on the map are still in the correct location, but as soon as i hit ""start"" it takes me to a completely random location 2 miles away from my destination.  The pins are exactly where they were before, but the directions are completely broken when using custom pins.  I use pins to mark specific parking lots within a campus or neighborhood, so it takes me through the correct entrance, but that's no longer possible.  Please fix!",0,
"Google maps has always been the best navigator I’ve ever used. The accuracy and all the other features are simply awesome. But, the latest update the avoiding tolls feature is no more available and I don’t know how to do it. It kept taking me to roads with tolls everywhere. I wish Google team add it back next update.",0,
Straight  up trash application. Many times the GPS shows me to be driving through woods or some body of water when I'm actually on the road. The last straw was when it showed me going backwards on the freeway.....Yeah. Apple maps is better but with less overall content and data.,0,
I love google maps but it would be nice if they could come out with a truck map or if you could within google maps select the vehicle you are driving I am a class a driver and at times when I was using the company gps I would have fathered use google but you could not set height and get low bridge information so it could not be used,0,
"Google Maps was really good when I first downloaded it, but it keeps relocating and re-centering while I’m driving. One minute I have 35 miles to drive, and the next I have to take a random exit.  Overall it has taken me to the right locations, but always after it has strayed from the original route. It’s frustrating, and I end up driving more than I intended to via unknown backroads.",0,
"I live in Philadelphia (Manayunk to be specific) and I don’t know know what you guys did with the latest update, but for two days now this app has been unusable for me. It literally cannot track me, nor does it place me on an actual Street. On top of that, it would literally keep recalculating itself once I managed to get things working. Have confirmed it’s not my phone by using other applications (Apple Maps, Waze, etc). Someone messed up big time, and i can’t use this until it’s fixed.",0,
"John and his crew came out and removed a huge oak in my, hard to access back yard. No problem for these guys, I was very impressed by their professionalism.

"But since I can’t add bad reviews to apple apps, I’ll put a good review here. Google maps is great. Apple maps tell you to turn after you’ve driven past the turn. Google maps wants to get you to your destination, Apple maps wants to have you drive into someone’s living room.",0,
"I was used to google map in the past few years and have always considered it a good app with efficient navigation. However since 2017, I have no idea why google map turns like this. It always changes route and confused me all the time. The fastest route it provides are not even as fast as the slowest route. It sometimes navigate me to some small path that seems to be not reasonable at all. After all, I suggest google should test all the coders they hired in the google map team to see if they are truly qualified.",0,
"Aside from getting me lost on several occasions, the map put my house in a different location.  I have reached out to google maps in various ways and numerous occasions I have sent them the issue and requested a correction. All of my requests for change have been denied. Because of this, my medical transport had to send 5 different driver to pick me up in 1 day and they all went to the wrong location and cancelled. I was unable to make it to the doctors that day. Keeps happening cuz they won’t change the map.",0,
"It would be very helpful if the M’app stated specific locations for Metro, Bus &amp; other type of stops. i.e.; N E Corner, 1/2 down the block. S W Side of the Street (W) West. Or some variation there of. I have missed or boarded the wrong bus/train several times due to ambiguity, missing signage and illogical vehicle direction. Additionally a small compass to accompany this improvement would be Phenomenal. This is the type of feature(s) that set Google far Apart from their competition.",0,

"There are two changes that are really annoying and actually causes an extra step (which is extra time). 1. When you are traveling, you used to be able to click the top bar and see all of the following steps. Now you have to click the the bottom bar and then directions to see all of the steps. 2. It doesn't have the Home and Work address in the first screen when you look up directions. I have to start typing in Home and Work for it to search and then I can click it. The above issues are annoying and creates an extra step that is unnecessary. When you're in a hurry, you just need everything right there, just one click away.",0,

"I really like Google Maps for several reasons. 1) My vehicles do not have navigation systems. 2) Portable GPS devices must be manually updated often with the most current maps. 3) I can download Google Maps on any of my wireless devices with the ability to view and use current GPS information. 4) Maps are automatically updated with Google Maps, so I can be assured I have the most current information at all times. 5) I enjoy using Google Maps satellite capabilities to pan down on my home now or my childhood home.  Also I can pan down anywhere on earth.",0,

Google maps is great. The thing that would make it better is to be able to choose a via point. On our old Garmin we could put in a via point (like a restaurant or something) &amp; go there without having to put in your route again. I loved that feature &amp; wish Google would add it.,0,
I use your map in conjunction with the map on the weather channel map and Google maps to get the necessary details. Four of my friends are on the “Great American Loop”. I am following their vessels on my iPhone and have to switch among these maps in order to get more details. It would be great if all of this information could be obtained on one iPhone app.,0,
"Was working fine before, after most recent update it only works if manually typing in address. If app opens from a link like for example opening from door dash app with address already entered it hangs and just has the spinning circle forever, it never loads no matter how long you wait. But if you manually enter the address then it will work. What’s the point in updating if you just make it worse?? Fix this please or else gonna delete and just use Apple maps!",0,

"I have an iPhone 11 Pro Max with iOS 13 installed and google maps - my gps go-to for years - is essentially unusable for me in its current state. It no longer vocalizes turn instructions and increasingly provides slow, inaccurate directions. Just ran a test with my phone vs my wife’s iPhone XS with iOS 12 installed, and it’s night and day - google maps works fine on her phone, barely works at all on mine. Google needs to fix this ASAP.

"Used to be a good app but lately the traffic avoiding algorithms have been routing me (and apparently a lot of other drivers) to standstills.  Happened most recently on a trip to San Diego where traffic in the freeway was moving slow.  Google maps tried to lead me on a bypass that ended up adding an additional 25 minutes to my trip.  Their map showed no traffic even though there was 1.5 miles of stop and go.  Also, on my iPhone 11, the “next turn” navigation is about 2-3 turns behind the gps locator.",0,

"I see Google has disabled the ability to turn off the status light in their Nest cams due to so-called “privacy issues.” Now it seems like they’ve followed suit with the removal of street view. If this is the case, they will have rendered the entire app worthless. Street view is really the only thing that distinguishes Google Maps from Apple Maps. If it’s gone, then we might just as well use the default app. Street view has been available for years. Why are you tampering with a good thing, Google?",0,

"Hello, recently in July my son and I went to Orlando Florida from Connecticut and rented a car from the airport. Over the years I had used Waze and other apps even before Google introduced and perfected their app. Because I thought Google has a better product. From the airport as we start driving using google maps, not only the map start acting weird it won’t update in time to make the turns it was laggy and finally we had to use the Apple map which was fine. Very disappointed. Tom from CT",0,
"This app is one of a kind. I use it everday like addicted. I only wish it was also showing my driving speed, then it would be 100% perfect. I'm very happy to see that they added speed limits to navigation screen today. If you hear me please add driving speed too. Thanks so much.",0,

This was my first time using Google Maps and I am nervous.  I was driving to an unfamiliar area and hoped that all would go smoothly.  I am pleased to say that the directions were easy to follow and got me exactly where I was supposed to be! You will now be my- go to- app for directions!!,0,
This is the best map and navigation app and service available today. Unfortunately Google likes to play games to force users to log in and data-mine them. 1) Log in: They won’t let you store offline maps without logging in. 2) Location History: They require location history to be turned on and they want ALWAYS permission to access your location if you want to share your real time location with other users. You can’t even receive others current location without giving them ALWAYS permission. 3) Web and App Activity: Once you log in they won’t let you save home and work locations without enabling Web and App Activity. There is no reason for some of these restrictions other than to annoy/force users to give them permission to data-mine you. Goodbye Google Maps.,0,

"Please REMOVE the annoying Explore Nearby pop up, that opens every single time I open your Maps application. 99% time people open Maps they are near home and know what is nearby. It’s been like this now for two years and no off switch. So annoying. So much unnecessary ... things... jammed inside what should be a simple maps application. It also makes GPS during driving more dangerous.",1,"Thanks for the review.

"I can’t live without google maps however, the only annoying part it doesn’t give you enough warning about when to exit. In busy cities it takes time to change lanes so having frequent announcements about the next exit would be great. It can be configurable if some users feel it’s too much.",0,
"My god, when did Google Maps get so bad? Apparently they decided you don’t need to know street names when getting directions. Just “turn right in a quarter mile.” Sorry but I can’t estimate exactly how much a quarter mile is when there are 5 roads to turn right on within 1000 feet of each other. Also called an exit off of the freeway a “fork.” And finally, stop opening up and suggesting places to eat and other stuff. I know what I’m looking for, I don’t want you to tell me. Google Maps is for maps not recommendations",0,
Whenever I try to use google maps it always turns out to be a complete waste of my precious time! Can I get a holla for normal maps!?!! The app never talks to me even when my volume is turned all the way up and mute is not on. It is extremely dangerous to drive while looking at your phone every few seconds for which way to turn! At least on Apple Maps talks! I was so close to am accident because I was so busy looking at my phone for directions and forgot to change lanes in time. Ughhh soannoying,0,

"Best navigation app hands down. I use it to navigate, find businesses and phone numbers and remember a location (I’m a visual person and Maps is a great assistant). Only improvement I can suggest is the Share Location / ETA feature. Cannot share location “Always” on iPhone - just kills the battery (ugh). Would prefer that feature worked in “While using the App” setting.",0,
"This app is spiraling downhill with every update. What is this Explore vs Commute business? What people look at is traffic, public transit, satellite, etc. All those options are hidden in “layers” but the Explore and Commute tabs are just taking up screen real estate?

Thanks for fixing the Apple Music integration bug btw, which literally made my phone unusable until I deleted the app last week.",0,
I love the app the only thing I would add is the speed limit in the area that we travel in and weather along the route because I travel the country a lot by driving so I frequently use the app for directions. That update would be awesome,1,"Speed limits in navigation should be available in your country! Thank you for your patience as we roll this feature out. To use this feature (once it’s available to you) in the latest version of Google Maps just start driving navigation. In some locations, the maximum speed limit appears as a black and white box. In other locations, the maximum speed limit may appear as a red and white circle.

"In many of my travels I desire to be able to look at different locations, routes, and  venues concurrently. It would be nice to have a tabbed interface so as to have debility to look new content without having to lose the current content. Something like allowing multiple browser tabs would be very handy",0,
"As we are on our road trip and using this app, (because the iPhone map app is horrible) we want to also be able to find testy restaurants or gas stations on the way. Please give us the ability to while have one longer distance destination in route we can also find other things along the way. Cheers !",0,
"This app has been the only app you need for me for many years now.   Zoom in an area you want to find a specific item.  A restaurant, or a specialty store.  Anything and it’s right there with following directions.   Simply no other similar app is this flawless and solid.  8 Stars our of 5.",0,
"I’ve used Google Maps for years now and always loved it. Over the past couple months it has seemed to experience more and more issues though. One issue is that every time I turn on navigation it randomly chooses between two completely different looking user interfaces. I can find no rhyme or reason as to why it changes back and forth so much. Another reason is that it has become impossible to find options to avoid highways or tolls. I can change the layers, edit options, view route previews, but cannot find a way to avoid highways or tolls (I’ve definitely used these options in the past). Even if the option is hidden somewhere, to make a navigation app as unintuitive as that is insane. Never thought I would switch to Apple maps, but at least I can choose to avoid tolls in it.",0,
"This used to be such an awesome app. My most trusted navigator. Lately though it does very poorly at recognizing the cars location and direction of travel. Maybe this is because Apple screwed up on the latest IOS update? I guess that would make more sense since they have a bad track record of half baked software as opposed to Google. Still, it’s frustrating that such a great app is having problems.",0,
"I’ve used Google Maps forever, but it seems lately (the most recent version?) I often can’t see the names of streets. I would think this would be a key feature and at the top of the priority list for a map app. I pinch, zoom in, etc to see where I am supposed to turn (I don’t like using the step by step instructions), but nope, no street name. Frustrating.",0,
"This app is a good way to find out where places are, but I would not use it because most of the time it does not list a majority of the places in my town. It also does not measure the distance from my current location to my destination correctly. The miles and the kilometers are way off. I would like to see some improvements in this program. I will start using it again when they finally fix this issue.",0,
"This update apparently turns Live Traffic off each time the app is closed, as oppose to saving that option. It’s a huge pain!  Change it back so that that my traffic is turned ON until I turn it OFF.  Leaving home in the morning? Check traffic!  Leaving work in the evening? Check traffic! This is by far my most used app, and you’ve taken away the thing I love about it the most!",1,"Thank you for letting us know about this issue, and your patience as we fixed the problem. We appreciate it! With the latest update, Google Maps should now be working as usual."
When I went to therapy I could hardly walk and the pain was bad. I went for about 3months and I am about 90 per better. They do good hands on massages. The excercise is very helpful. I still do them everyday.  I have been to therapy before but it was not the kind you get here. I am glad I got a chance to go.,0,
"On a recent trip Mexico(1st time to Mexico) Google Maps was the only GPS operational app that allowed us to navigate in our rental car between Leon BJX airport to San Miguel de Allende. During this 1.5 hour plus trip we suffered no signal loss, unlike other GPS apps that I tried. Kudos to Google maps, took us from points A to B and back and never got lost. Pete V. Round Rock, Tx.",0,
"Wish it did not monitor my location all the time.  The “only when in use” means it won’t help you navigate unless the app is open.  But if I’m not using google maps, I really do t want Google monitoring my location.  My perception (which may be wrong) is that Apple and Apple maps takes my privacy more seriously.",0,
"I’ve never been a fan of the Apple maps app until recently updating to iOS 11. It’s so much more fluid that google maps, and I constantly had to deal with google failing to reroute last minute and update/load the route, determine which road I was actually on especially on roads that are close or run alongside a highway. Too many times have I been sent the wrong direction because of this but I finally had enough and switched over.",0,
"The Google Maps App does not begin to operate until you have started driving for a short period of time.  During this time, you may be going in the wrong direction then the direction suggested.  After map is operational, there are no problems.  This issue has been since the last couple of updates.",0,
"wanted to take the time to leave a review because i just wasted my half hour lunch driving around looking for a location that was nowhere to be found. i’m extremely frustrated and upset with the quality of this app. unfortunately it’s still better than the other navigation apps so i don’t really have a choice to stop using google maps. however, the company should really get better data recording what roads are blocked and if locations are located inside other buildings so that the directions are more accurate. thanks google maps for wasting my time, gas and most importantly, taking away my time to eat food. do better.",0,
"I have always relied on Google Maps on my commute to and from work each day to show traffic delays. However, for the last two months Google maps has stopped showing traffic during my morning commute to work. Will work properly only in the afternoon. Because of this app not working, I now use another app to assist my morning travel.",0,
"The 3D Press shortcut to navigate to home or work is broken. The app usually just hangs in the navigation when opening with one of these shortcuts. It seems the ""current location"" isn't being found. Since Google is so big it's frustrating to deal with a bug like this; I reported it but have no idea if anyone is even working on it (two app updates since still gave the bug). So here's your 2-star review ✌️",0,
"I’ve had google maps for years and these past updates are extremely bad. I have an iPhone X, latest software &amp; app is always up to date. Apple maps never disconnects and google maps always disconnects and reroutes randomly after that. It’s so frustrating because I end up taking longer to arrive to my destination due to these complications. I’m done with this app. Deleting &amp; using Apple maps instead. Updates aren’t fixing bugs they’re just adding bugs.",0,
"While u driving, the app forcefully suggests direction. If you missed it, because you pay attention to the road, the app will change your way. There are many ways to get home, but you choose one you want. Yet if u missed suggestion, it will take you different way, the way you did not want it in the first place.  No way to turn off this future. Plus map starts to freeze and try to redirect right on intersections. Its ok if its in the town, but not ok when driving interstate roads.",0,
I've noticed that location data can be toggled and it keeps the best guestimate of the location of the device reporting. It's features are awesome verbose and even precise. The detailed 3D map with Street view just completes this app along with feedback and ratings! Awesome Job!!!,0,
I have Using Google Maps since the very beginning.I have tried other navigation apps but I always come back to Google Maps there one of the best as far as accurate locations and customizable to where you’re at and to you.,0,
Google maps is great but I think it needs to be able to find or make map clear with in one or two bars of Internet if you have no Internet you should still be able to work google maps and under all that I think Google maps is great we just need some update a few things.🌹,0,
"I’ve had the app stop navigating halfway through my route MANY times. Having to check on it while driving because I think to myself, “the navigation hasn’t said anything in ten minutes, I hope it’s still on,” is not great. It also switches routes sometimes, which is sometimes okay and sometimes not. If I’m trying to avoid a specific highway and choose a route accordingly, I want it to keep that route the entire way.",0,
"I use this thing like a bible. I have for years. For some reason it won’t track well with IOS 12 on iPhone 8, but then I see there are GPS issues with the later versions of iPhone anyway. Still, some on the fly navigation voice directions aren’t always spot on in New York City. All together this is business equipment for me and grateful it’s still free",0,
I spend hours on this app and it has been my #1 used app since I can remember. Will never say anything bad but now it won’t load all the pictures while scrolling. It just stops. Hopefully it’s fixed soon! It works on PC just not on phone. Please fix soon,0,
"There is just no comparison of Google Maps vs. the free Maps app that came on my iPhone. I got totally lost going to an important meeting using my iPhone app. The next time I used Google Maps &amp; found the meeting location without a single wrong turn! Thanks For Your Google Maps, Larry from FL",0,
"This app is been such a close part of my daily life. It is WAY more resourceful compared to other Navigation apps. I especially love the adding new locations or photos of existing locations, hence it is more open to the user contributions. Only downside cannot add new locations in China.",0,
"The new all white background looks awful. I need travel time WITHOUT TRAFFIC. This used to be a feature and I don’t know why it was removed. I plan my travel in advance and rush hour or accidents throws the estimated time way off. I wish that when I search a town or city, the most frequent place I go to there came up first on the selection list.",1,"Thank you for letting us know about this issue, and your patience as we fixed the problem. We appreciate it! With the latest update, Google Maps should now be working as usual."
"Whenever I try to start navigation from the widget, it asks me to click “Start” before it starts navigating. Even thought I have skinny fingers, the button is too small and it often drags up the instruction part instead of starting the navigation. It’s pretty annoying. Maybe make the button bigger or allow us to directly start navigation from the widget and eliminate unnecessary clicking.",1,Lets give clearing your phones cache and restarting your phone to possibly improve this issue for you like it has for others.

"I’ve been using Google Maps for years and lately it’s been falling short. For some reason, it stopped saying my directions ahead of time and now says then when I’m at or past whatever direction I was supposed to follow.

For the past few months I’ve been having major issues with Google Maps. The app keeps thinking I’m walking when I’m clearly driving. I even tried force closing the app and after it reloads it still thinks I’m walking but I’m driving over 30 miles per hour? It also doesn’t help that Google doesn’t provide a way to select if you’re driving or walking. This greatly screws up time-frames on when you will get to your destination. It’s making me want to start use Apple Maps now...,0,
"We are on Google Earth. However our address can’t be entered into Google Maps. Therefore if friends or Service Technicians are relying on your Map App they can’t get to our home.

I like that you’re synced with Bluetooth, but please sync with Google Earth!",0,
Google maps is amazing it always helps me when I’m lost and always find me unlike Apple Maps who can consistently get me Lost which I do not enjoy being especially in the country or in some far out the middle of nowhere! So thank you Google maps I love you,0,
"it could really get changed when your audio directions are on it mixes up traffic circle exits and says exit one is where you are and it’s actually on the right, exit two which is actually straight forward, exit three which is on the left, and exit four is where you turn all the way around.",0,
This is my go to app before I head home every evening and out the door to work every morning. It just depends on where maps tells me to go that I know what time I’m expected to arrive. I can shave off 10-15 minutes sometimes. That is priceless!,0,
I can’t tell you enough of how awesome the team was when we had our move. Reebie impressed us the first time so we decided to use them again. I highly recommend Reebie for any move you might have. Thanks for taking care of our things and being on time.,0,
"Google Maps actually lets the driver know which lane to be in to complete a step. For example, it lets me know that I can stay in the THREE right lanes to get where I’m going. That’s helpful because it keeps me from trying to get into the farthest right lane to turn right unnecessarily.",0,
Google Maps has saved me from many many many traffic jams. One additional feature i’d like to see is a weather indicator. I could see a potential partnership with a popular and reliable weather service.,0,
"Adding stops along the way made a huge difference, but still needs a little improvement. 1) Be able to see just total miles and time instead of just each section. 2) Be able to add the amount of time you intend to spend at each stop to better plan your trip.",0,
I did an update yesterday and now the app is acting crazy. It keeps flashing white blocks along my route. I got so excited because I finally figured out how to plan a trip with several destinations. I do several construction site inspections in a day and it would be great to be able to plan the fastest route to get through them all. But after I planned my trip and made it to my first destination then my trip disappeared.,0,
"Google map doesn’t get updated on traffic and road construction/blocks in Ontario, Canada. I’m often guided to take routes that are blocked due to construction. Google map often offers poor re-route options when it doesn’t know which road is blocked, or which new traffic signs have been placed (i.e new no left turn signs, new oneway st sign.). Often face confusion when facing such situations when commuting to and from major cities such as Toronto, Kitchener, Hamilton and really anywhere in Ontario.",0,
"The new “ Explore Nearby” annoying pop-up drives (pun intended) me crazy.  If I want to explore, I can ask. I’m usually just trying to navigate or check traffic.  It takes longer to load.

"It was my first day in the neighborhood the first time I went to Augies. By the end of the day I had been there three times. They had the game I wanted to watch available on tv.

"Google Maps is the default navigation on my work tablet. I drive as a profession and it’s a mix of highway and secondary roads with occasional tertiary roads. I run this app on the tablet while running Waze on my iPhone. Waze beats out Google maps 9/10 times. Brand new apartment complexes and medical buildings all show up on Waze where on here not so much. I used to swear by Google Maps but after testing it out many times, it is mediocre at best now.",0,
"This is my go to app for maps. I am everything Apple in terms of hardware, but google’s head start and continuous investment in this GPS mapping make it the best. I’ll occasionally compare Apple maps and Google maps for a side by side of my destination and it consistently delivers more accurate ETAs and real time course corrections.",0,
I used to prefer google maps over any other map application but it just told me about its timeline function where it tells you everywhere you've been at what time. If that isn't creepy idk what is. Also what am i even supposed to use that for? If I'm hungover and don't remember where i was the previous night? Creepy feature that's going to scare me into using google maps less.

"I have always loved Google Maps and think it is far better than Apples map app. With that being said, a few days ago I noticed it was VERY SLOW to update where I was and therefore wasn’t able to give me directions. I figured it must be my phone so I restarted and nothing. Every time since then I’ve tried to use this app it does that so it’s essentially useless because it doesn’t register where I am. So I’ve been forced to use Apple maps. Please fix this ASAP so I can go back to using it!!",1,"Thank you for letting us know about this issue, and your patience as we fixed the problem.

Believe it or not, those of us who live in cities do quite a lot of walking from place to place.",1,"3/7/18 Did this resolve your concerns? 2/26/18 Thank you for your review. In Google Maps, if you search for or tap the place to which you want to navigate, then tap Directions at the bottom of the screen, the top of the next screen will show you different transportation modes (i.e. driving, walking, biking). You can switch between the modes by touching the one you want."
"I’ve used this app for years when it used to be so much better than apple maps. Now Maps is better. Today, I left the house without checking carefully the route and it took me all over. What it should have been a straight couple miles on an easy road, ended up being 12 minutes on one highway after the other with no place to stop and review the map or change apps. I’m not happy at all with today’s experience.",0,
"I just re-downloaded the app on my iPhone, specifically for the Mario feature that’s supposed to be rolled out today. It’s a fresh download, but I have no Mario :( I want him to guide me on a road trip today. (Still prefer this to Apple Maps, so I won’t give y’all a bad review. I just want that little dude to tell-a me where-a to go)",0,
"I’m new to the Corpus Christi, TX area &amp; was looking for a pet store to groom my dog. Google, in all its wisdom, incorrectly told me that the store was located in Corpus, but also the incorrect mileage from my location. As I was following Google Maps’ directions to a location 24 miles out of the way (since I had already booked the appointment), it screwed me again by giving me directions to a cemetery more than 5 miles from the correct location &amp; in the wrong town. So to recap: 1) Wrong location on initial search led to an appoint being scheduled 2) Wrong mileage on Google Maps 3) Wrong directions on Google Maps 4) Wrong town on Google Maps to top of the disaster that was supposed to take about 45 minutes to 1 hour of my afternoon. I’d give 0 stars if I could. From now on I’ll use the Apple service. What a joke 🙄",0,
"Used to enjoy using google maps (iPhone 8 and 6s user) but since the recent update the app has completely lost functionality. If you want to avoid frustration, glitches, loading, lagging, and going to the complete wrong place don’t use this app or do not install the update !!!!! The my maps feature no longer works I use this for route planning my work and now it is all just wasted time. The app navigation is no longer user friendly. So disappointed in google.",0,
I love to use google maps. It has always been my go to. Now whenever I put in my point B it will say x amount of miles away. Once you click on it to confirm it is actually 3-7 miles off so instead of 16 miles away it’s 23 miles away. Or 3 miles away and actually 8 miles away. Also slowing down it seems. It will update me too late and then I have missed a turn etc.,0,
I took my cat to PETS as a result of an accidental poisoning. The staff was immediately attentive to my cat as well as myself.

I recommend PETS to anyone with a loved pet who needs emergency care.,0,
"I wish Google would stop messing with the application, the application is very messy, it doesn’t give you exact directions and even sometimes it gets confused while traveling, it’s really a waste of my time, I mostly use it to find what’s @ the address I’m going to and also to look at the nearby streets of the place, but not to get directions, Google stop messing with the app while, your ruining it!!!",0,
“You can save 8 minutes by taking this alternative route” only to be ensnared in a complete disaster of traffic for over 45 min as you can literally see the original route on the highway plugging along. Waze did a much better job of organizing drivers to avoid just sending *everyone* to the new route to completely ruin the benefit of saving time. Your altos are essentially forcing unnecessary traffic jams instead of alleviating them.,0,

"Don't rely on this app to tell you if your turning onto a turnpike that you have to have an EZPass for. Mine didn't and I was forced onto a treacherous one way onramp that cost me $45 which normally costs $4. The app will not warn you it will just tell you to turn. Be safe, don't rely solely on apps, and I hope you don't have to pay an exorbitant fee as I did. The app will tell you 9,483 places to eat but wont differentiate between toll roads.",0,

The voice will tell me left, when the app says right, so i constantly need to look at my phone to know where my turn actually is.

Zoom levels out of whack.  A decent zoom level for a 19 mile commute showed all green.  When in fact it put me in a major traffic jam over a mile long.    When I pinched the screen to zoom in it showed solid dark red.  Zoom out green again. Zoom in red.  THANKS you piece of $41t.

"Sometimes the best route for me is a single bus option without a transfer, and this app does not provide that. It only gives me the option to transfer between buses even though one bus gives me the actual route that I need. There needs to be an option to see where one bus route takes me, so I don’t have to transfer everywhere to get me where on bus would drop me off.",0,

This app is usually pretty good...but has been very inaccurate lately for some reason. I have missed several connections and been late because of it! Hope you guys can fix whatever is happening.

I have been using this forever and in the last week or so I cannot use it to search any address or even click on a suggestion and pull up a map let alone directions. I continually get “No results” or There is a problem with that suggestion” error messages which make this app unusable.

I love this app.  I use it over any other map app.  However the addition of CarPlay has caused some unneeded issues.  I am now not able to search for a gas station on my route.  This has been able to save me countless amount of money over the years. Also.  I have noticed that when I pull out the cord it doesn’t go back to the normal app  I think it still thinks it is plugged in for some reason.,0,

Really needs Speed Limit integration and higher quality voice prompts. One of the main reasons  I use Apple maps over this is because it’s more polished imo. Siri’s voice when speaking turn-by-turn is (not perfect) but the audio is SUCH better quality that it’s almost laughable that the the world’s biggest map platform (Google) has the 2nd crappiest voice behind Waze (which incidentally is now owned by Google).

"Well, google map used to be the one and only proper app. But lately about 50% time it gives inaccurate direction. Try to force to take longer route even after shorter route is available.

The recent update deleted all of my labels so now I have to type in the entire address anytime I want to go to places that I frequent.

"Sharing is buried in an ellipsis menu in the search result page.

"Maps used to be a 1-stop shop for general local geographical info. Now it's morphed into a restaurant-pushing juggernaut.  If course, this is a slight exaggeration:  the app really focuses on commerce, tourism, commerce, and venues where one can spend money. I checked the new settings and disabled &gt;188&lt; different cuisines to eliminate some of the clutter on the display.   188!   What a privileged &amp; pampered society we have become.

"It's very frustrating interacting with the maps on my phone. If I try to use two fingers to pinch and zoom, often it thinks I'm trying to ""tap"" with one of my fingers, and it selects a business or drops a pin. Then when I try to select a business, I might be two pixels off, and it'll drop a pin next door. Sometimes when I double tap, it zooms in. Other times, it drops a pin. The way this app interprets gestures is seriously flawed. And the way they fill the map with lots of unnecessary landmarks makes it hard to tell what's important.

Aaaaaand again another pointless update. Why is it apps feel like updating perfect functions with silly replacements? And if I had a dollar for every time Google maps had no clue what actual traffic patterns were. And if I had a dollar for every time Google lied about faster routes. I'm pretty sure that they are working with cities to reroute traffic to the benefit of anyone but the public. Waze is much better in many ways. See what I did there.,0,

Google maps’ recent update has gotten rid of the avoid tolls choice. Previously I did not have a prepaid toll road card and now I do. Well the settings to avoid them stayed and now I’m stuck following the directions for them. This is the worse thing you could’ve done by far. I have a 18 hour trip I’m taking New Year’s Day and I rely on using the tolls to cut it down to 16 hours instead.

So I had to use this app in manhattan New York. The app is unstable. It gives directions but middle of the path it changes its direction and then the compass starts pointing at direction. After 20 mins trying to find penn station I finally called a ride sharing service. Doubting my gps skill I gave my friend to use google gps. Even she got lost with this app. There should be an option to report a better route. It always took us to the longer route. The subway instructions were inaccurate.,0,

I just upgraded to the iPhone 11 and now google maps only shows traffic on the given routes.
